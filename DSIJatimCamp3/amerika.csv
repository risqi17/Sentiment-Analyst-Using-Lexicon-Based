american-airlines;2018-09-13;" |  Norfolk to Albuquerque . I am so frustrated with American Airlines. As everyone knows, Hurricane Florence is approaching the East Coast. Well, I have a flight schedule to leave on September 14th, the same day Hurricane Florence is set to make landfall. When I received word that I was able to change my flight and the fee will be waived, I called AA customer service line. I explained to the CS rep that I obtained my ticket with my points and I wanted to cancel my ticket and have my miles credited back to my account. She told me that it can be done. She went to explain to me that two things can happen. The first is, I can purchase another ticket with my points but, I have to fly before September 19th. I informed her that wouldn't work because, If I was not able to travel Friday (14th Sep) there was no reason to fly because I was traveling for a specific reason. So the second thing she tells me is, I could get credit for my points after I pay them $150.00 to credit the points back to my account. I told her that was crazy. Why would I pay $150 for something that I earned for paying full price. She also told me I could forfeit my points if I choose to. This entire conversation was so crazy to me. I told her, it wasn't like I was cancelling on my own, there was a pending storm coming. All she could say was she understood. I don't think she does. I know that I am not the only one that is going through this right now, but it sure feels that way. I knew there was a reason why I didn't fly AA. This Review is for the Customer Service experience, where it all starts. My actual rating is 0/10, however I don't have that option.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-12;" |  Nashville to Miami return. This was my first and last time flying with American Airlines. First off I payed $50 to check my baggage with them which is fine, no problem. When we landed back in Nashville I received my suitcase and saw a hole in the front and scratches all over my suitcase. I then went to their baggage service and she proceeds to tell me that there is nothing they can do about it that it doesn’t “cover”.  I paid you money to transport my luggage and there is nothing you can do about it? Terrible customer service and seriously will never fly with them again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-12;" |  Colorado Springs to Atlanta via Dallas. I had two delayed flights and three flight changes. I spent all day in airports and I paid extra for my tickets to receive better flight times. I certainly did not get my money's worth there. Every American representative at the airport, on the phone and via email blew me off. Worst customer service ever. I will drive before I ever use American Airlines again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-09;" |  Philadelphia to Ft Myers. Worst experience with an airline to date . They Cancel a 1040 flight at 8.15am, they then Book me on a 740pm night flight. Send me to gate B11 to find out it has been moved to gate B6 only after asking seeing the flight there is to Detroit. Don't give us the seats from the 1040 flight and charge us 24 dollars a seat extra for the isle seat they cancelled on us in the first place. Don't use this airline. Have had better experience on low fare airlines. Not a good experience will never book my personal or any of my business flights through this airline ever again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-09;" | 2 plus hours in plane delay was complimented with the crew busy in trying to sell their paid snacks rather than at least asking passengers for water, while air-conditioning was probably turned off as it became hot inside. Instead of 10:49 pm arrival they taxied on both airports for hours while not bothering to give the correct reason or offering any drinks. No wonder the reviews are so low.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-08;" |  American Airlines doesn’t care at all about its customers. No fresh food on the flight from Orlando to Washington DC. No opportunity to buy any real food on the plane for 5 hours (overall 3 hours late). They boarded us on time and then didn’t take off for another 2 hours. Landed 2 hours late and then spent 1 hour waiting for the gate. It’s clear from this experience that American Airlines truly does not care about anyone on their planes. Not the customers, flight attendants, or pilots. Everyone did their best to make it through the experience, but it was truly horrendous.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-08; |  Our flight was scheduled to leave Philadelphia at 7:05 PM. At 6 PM we were informed that our flight had been delayed until 8:20 PM. We began boarding the plane at 7:30 PM only to sit on the plane for the next five hours. At one point we taxied away from the gate only to return back to the gate several minutes later. The whole reason for our five hour delay was that we were waiting on airplane parts for a diabled plane in Glasgow Scotland. After they loaded the airplane parts and we were ready to leave informed us that we need to top off our gas because of the fuel used and taxiing out and having to taxi back to the gate. Then we were delayed again because we had ran out of bottled water on the plane after sitting for several hours. We were on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Glasgow for 12 hours for what should've been a 5.5 hour flight. Of course within missed our connecting flight which there is only one a day out of Glasgow to Stornoway. American Airlines just doesn't seem to be able to get their stuff together.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-08;" |  Greensboro to Bangor via Philadelphia. American continues to be US Airways with a new name only. Employees are dishonest and rude. I had a first class ticket to Bangor through Philadelphia which was delayed due to weather. No problem. Agent says they have a flight next morning he can put me on. He fails to say there is no first class service and doesn't even reserve a seat. Turns out the flight has a 30 minute connection window. Furthermore, AA agent lied about refunding me for my first class ticket. When I persisted, he claimed the puddle jumper they had put me on had nothing but first class seating! Not only are they dishonest, they apparently think their customers are idiots. This is exactly the reason I switched to Delta several years ago. I made them refund my $1000 first class ticket and I bought a flight on Delta for $250. I thought I'd give American another try, but they haven't changed a bit. I'll take my $100K/year spend back to Delta!";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-08;" |  Charlotte to Chicago. Horrible service. Flight was ""weather"" delayed so we were rebooked for a different flight. Was supposed to take off 10:25pm. Pushed to midnight because you don't have a backup crew at your main hub in Charlotte? Now the next announcement is 1:15am for the plane to get here? C'mon AA, get us a hotel room, meal voucher and stop wasting our time. I have been up and working since 6am. It is obvious that you don't care about your clients time. This will be a last business trip we book with you for a long time.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-08;" |  Tokyo Haneda to Los Angeles. The legroom in economy was appalling and the service mediocre. I'm 198cm tall (6'6""), and usually when I fly other airlines between Japan and the U.S., I can get some extra legroom at no cost --= either by asking for a bulkhead seat or an exit row. American, however, charges extra for these options. (Seriously!? I'm supposed to pay for the privilege of assisting other passengers in the event of an emergency?!) Other (non-U.S.) airlines consider this a matter of customer service. When the ground attendants see me, they usually understand my need. Moreover, the legroom in a normal economy seat on this flight was horrendous. I actually had way more legroom in a regular economy seat on my flight a few days later with Southwest between Los Angeles and Denver. That's right -- a low-cost carrier offered considerably more legroom on a 2.5-hour flight on a Boeing 737 than American did on a 10-hour flight on a Boeing 787. On top of this, I didn't see any of the flight attendants smile during the whole flight. They weren't actively unfriendly, but they barely even acknowledged passengers with eye contact. I tried to be a model passenger and say ""please"" and ""thank you"" when ordering and receiving drinks and food, but crew members didn't even acknowledge this with a ""You're welcome"" or a smile. Also, the food was decidedly substandard. A few things were good about the flight: The tickets were cheap, the flight was on time, and the entertainment system and options were good. Also, on my return flight the staff were a bit more friendly. These are the reasons I'm rating it a 4. This is why I always try to avoid US. carriers. Fly JAL, ANA, Singapore Airlines or any non-US carrier if you can.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-08;" |  Washington to Boston. It is now 10:30. My original flight from DCA to Boston was supposed to leave at 4:30. After boarding the aircraft, and waiting on the tarmac for 2.5 hours due to weather in Boston, we were told that the flight crew could no longer fly, due to time restrictions. We were told there would be a gate agent at the gate to guide us as we deplaned. There was no gate agent, and I was forced to wait in a 20 minute line only to be told that I could not be rebooked until AA cancelled the flight. An hour and a half later, I received a seat on a. 10 pm. Flight, that was delayed for 30 minutes. The boarding time was 10 pm. At 10:20 the passengers were told that there was a power problem that needed to be fixed. It is now 10:30. American, Your communication stinks, and your people do not have any proper procedures to deal with delays or cancellations. I have had it with you, and will never fly on your planes again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-07;" |  The worst experience ever! I booked tickets in March 2018 for a trip from Phoenix to DCA in June 2018. We were assigned seats in row 16 on the outbound flight and row 17 on the return flight. I happened to call the airline one week before the flight to ask a question about baggage fees. I was told that the seats had been changed and we were in row 33 on the outbound flight and row 32 on the return flight. The representative was of no help. I was also told that we had been assigned a new flight that was leaving and returning at a different time than the original flight. We were never told of the flight or seat changes and had I called in to ask about the baggage fees we would not have known until we checked in. After several calls I was told that I could “upgrade” my current seats to essentially the same seats I had originally booked for $300 extra. I paid the extra fees because I did not want to sit in the back of the plane. After several more phone calls I was told that they would look into giving me a credit for extra $300. They finally did give me credit for the additional $300 that I paid. That’s all they did. No apology. Nothing. This airline does not care about customer experience. In contrast, my wife and I had a Southwest flight that was just delayed two hours in leaving phoenix to San Francisco. Southwest gave us each a voucher for $100 for the inconvenience. It is hard to believe that an airline such as American does not value it’s customers. Here is the email that they sent regarding our experience… “Thank you for contacting American Airlines on behalf of XXX and XXXX XXXXXXXXX. I'm sorry the advanced seat assignments our mutual clients were given were not the seats they were scheduled to receive at the time of their departure after their flight experienced a schedule change/equipment change. I understand their frustration, as seating arrangements are important to our customers. Because there are several possibilities for why a passenger can lose their pre-requested seat assignment, such as a change in aircraft, a special needs customer, a child traveling alone etc., we cannot guarantee specific seats will be available on day of departure. While I am happy to hear that the XXXXXXXXXX received the seats they requested, albeit at an additional fee, there is no compensation due to them for their time and energy to sort their seating assignments out with a live agent. I am sorry.” I am disappointed with this airline and their customer service.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-06;" |  New York to Sydney via Charlotte / Los Angeles. Unremarkable or even bad service is frankly the norm on pretty much every airline in the US, with certain well-known exceptions. To expect anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment, as reflected by the majority of reviews for this airline. Yes, I too have experienced the dreaded day-long weather delay, but I still fly American because they handled the situation as well as could be expected and they don't control the weather. I flew from New York to Sydney with layovers in Charlotte and Los Angeles. My domestic short-haul flights were unremarkable. I had a tight connection in Charlotte (40 minutes) which I made with no problem thanks to helpful ground staff. Both flights were on older 737s without seatback or BYOD IFE. On the flight from JFK to CLT this was fine, but the 5 hour flight from CLT to LAX would have been unpleasant had I not had my own stuff on hand. Legroom on both flights was more than adequate. I am 6 feet tall, somewhat overweight, and had no issues with personal space. American's hard product is easily my personal favorite of the big three, even on older aircraft. Beverage service was brusque and impersonal, as is the norm, but flight attendants were very good in a one-on-one setting. There were frequent advertisements for AA-branded credit cards on both flights, taking the form of promotional videos and several in-flight announcements from flight attendants. Some announcements alluded to cardholder benefits not actually provided by the card, so be wary of that should you find the offer enticing, but I believe this was more a misunderstanding of the product by the FAs than a willful attempt to deceive. All in all, American's domestic service is perfectly reasonable, provided you have realistic expectations of what an airline is and isn't capable of doing. American's long haul international service greatly exceeded my admittedly minimal expectations. My flight from LAX to Sydney, clocking in at a whopping 15 hours, was a brand new 787-900 with a 3-3-3 layout in economy, a definite improvement over the 3-4-3 layout found on most American long haul metal. The seat provided ample legroom and storage space. Carry-on bins were large and easily accessible. IFE was provided by a large, high definition seatback screen. The selection was enormous, but leaned much more heavily to films over TV. The in-flight map is better than most US carriers. The interface for the IFE is somewhat frustrating at first. The default layout requires frequent swiping and dragging, which the touch screen is not very good at. This can be fixed by switching to a grid based display system, which I did not discover was an option until we were close to landing. There was also a catalogue of music and books available though the system, but the selection was not very good. Dinner and breakfast were served to all passengers on this flight. Meals were surprisingly good, being flavorful and well-portioned in both instances. I enjoyed about 7 hours of rest on this flight, which is much better than the 2 or 3 I generally manage to hobble together flying to Europe. The 787 is a wonderful aircraft, and is easily my first choice when flying overseas. All in all, my round trip flight from New York to Sydney cost $1400 per person, an excellent value. I would fly American again, both domestically and internationally.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-05;" |  Phoenix to Atlanta. Worst service ever! I flew with my 2 year old daughter and we both were given an aisle seat. I asked the rep if any other seats were available so I could sit with my child. She rolled her eyes. I'm guessing because I interrupted the personal conversation she was having with the other rep, I know it was personal because they each made no attempt at concealing this detail. She then asked for my boarding pass and continued her conversation with the other employee. She printed my new boarding passes and placed them on the desk in front of me. All without stopping her conversation or looking me in the eye. After the flight, I get home and my laptop will not power on. I suspected my bag was miss handled because I had broken items in the bag. I was left a ticket stating that TSA searched my checked bags. Now I have to pay $200 to get my laptop fixed. American airlines has absolutely no respect for their customers!";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-05;" |  Gulfport to Kansas City. Very disappointed with American Airlines. Will not fly again. We are trying to leave the Gulf to get back home due to hurricane but were told we we wouldn't be allowed to move flight up a day since flights were not being canceled unless we paid 200 dollars each. (There were 2 of us.) So we did because we didn't want to risk it. Then our flight that we changed to gets canceled and we were told we could get our original flight back but not the 200 dollars each because we ""voluntarily changed it"". Yes but you ""voluntarily canceled"" our flight. Thanks for keep 400 dollars of a teacher's paycheck.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-05;" |  Chicago to Knoxville. Returning home from a trip overseas is never easy, fortunately there’s American Airlines to help. Not only will they cancel your flight, they won’t give you any sort of compensation for a hotel reservation. Additionally, American Airlines won’t make any efforts to make sure you’re on the next available flight to your home town. If you like apathetic, lazy customer experience, then you’ll love American Airlines. As an American, I feel embarrassed that these clowns supposedly represent the US. Within the past few weeks I’ve flown Delta, Norwegian, as well as EasyJet. Several of these have been long, international flights over eight hours long. My American Airlines flight was domestic, and barely two hours long. Leave it to American Airlines to be the painful conclusion to your otherwise pleasant travels.  I’m going to give them one star though, as my plane didn’t crash.  American Airlines has managed to disappoint in almost every other aspect. Long story short, these fools are not reliable in anyway other than being reliably unreliable. Make the smart move and take your business elsewhere.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-04;" | We paid for premium flight times so we could arrive at a reasonable time on our outgoing flight to San Jose, Costa Rica and return flight via Miami. However, what we received from AA instead were red-eye flights, cancelled flights without explanation, and unanticipated expenditures associated with AA’s treatment of the 3 of us. And then AA had the audacity to offer us $100 in a voucher for a future flight on AA. By our calculations, AA made a lot more than $100 off each of us by cancelling flights that weren’t full, traveling during non-peak travel times-with AA pocketing the profits-forcing us to pay for hotels and transportation fees out-of-pocket, holding us hostage in airports with ever changing departure times, where we had no other option, but to eat airport food at premium prices, without the courtesy of respecting the sales contract by flying us out at your scheduled departure and arrival times.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-04;" |  Washington to Charlotte. Unbelievable, by far the worst airline I have ever travelled with. I have been flying on low cost airlines that are much better than American Airlines. My flight was supposed to take off from Baltimore at 2pm, but was cancelled after 3 hours of waiting, because they didn't manage to fix an A/C problem in the cockpit! They put me on a flight departing 6 hours later from Washington. They wouldn't provide a refund, they wouldn't provide a lounge pass or a voucher to get something to eat, the sit they gave me was worse than the previous one and (cherry on the cake) they forced me to check in my carry-on, so I had to board holding all the valuables, batteries, computer, etc. in my hands. As it wasn't bad enough already, all the above was communicated with the rudest possible manners one could use. Thanks - I am paying for this, in case you didn't know. As always, to even see a movie on board you need to use your own device, internet is for purchase, the only food they provide is a mini package of pretzels. Dear American Airlines, I take more than 50 flights a year and I swear you'll never see me again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-04;" |  Oklahoma City to Melbourne, Florida. The flight started with a delay on the tarmac, “maintenance and paperwork” 20-30 min. On our approach to Charlotte for my layover I realized we were circling the area? The pilot eventually lets us know we’re in a holding pattern because of weather issues and that if it persist we would have to fly to another airport to refuel. We did, we had to refuel in Tri City Tennessee. By this time I’ve missed my connecting flight to Melbourne! Once we landed in Charlotte I exited the plane to find the entire airport in complete chaos! I check in at the ticket desk to find out what flight I now need to catch to finally get to my destination, Melbourne Fl. At this point the ticket agent let me know, there were no more flights to Melbourne! “Go to customer service” I did, once there the customer service agent was rude, incompetent to the point another agent had to help navigate the computer system! End result, I had a choice, stay the night in Charlotte at a hotel on my dime, “because it isn’t American Airlines fault, there was weather issues” so no they will not put you up in a hotel and catch the flight in the morning to Melbourne OR catch a flight to Orlando International. I did, I’m now out an additional $150 for a hotel and I’ve had to have my wife come and pick me up in Orlando and drive me back to Melbourne to pick up my vehicle. I will never fly American Airlines again. I started my journey Sunday 9-2-18 1:40 pm it’s now 9-3 10:18 am and I’m still at the Orlando International Airport waiting on my ride. It will be beyond a 24hr trip to get from Oklahoma to Florida via flying American Airlines!";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-09-03;" |  San Francisco to Los Angeles. Today affirmined to me why it’s always worth it to spend just that little bit extra to fly Delta. After narrowly missing my flight I was reassigned to the next flight 7 hours later, fine, my fault. I slept at the airport and tried to make the most of it. Thankfully there was room on the morning flight since I was then a standby ticket but what I didn’t realize was my ticket had also been downgraded. Apparently there is a situation when you don’t get a carry on. I get to the front of the line, they look at my ticket, and say my new ticket is going to cost me an extra $50 for the carry on luggage. Wow. It doesn’t seem huge but delivered in the rudest of possible ways after 7 hours on an airport floor does not work for me. Delta is worth the extra $5-$20 in ticket price for sure.";NEGATIVE

Especially someone who is as kind as this woman was and going above and beyond to try to help in what ways she can. I've watched people scream, curse, and try to bully this woman and she has remained civil and polite through it all. Impressed with the staff. Disappointed with the customers.";POSITIVE

We left the house at 2am to make it to our flight on time, which ended up being delayed 5 different times due to ""mechanical issues"".

There wasn’t anyone there to let people know or a notice put up, nothing. We were then told that the new gate flight had already left, they changed it during the 2 hours we were in the air in our first flight. We complained and they insisted it was our own fault because they said they never print gate numbers on their tickets, when I showed them my ticket with a gate number on it that they had given me 3 hours previous they said it was still our fault for not looking at the monitors. They also said we should have known when no one was waiting, but lobby was full of people waiting. I went to speak to manager and she rebooked my party of 5 on the next flight 8 hours later so we waited and we had a non refundable tour booked in New Orleans that we were now missing. The manager said she could upgrade 4 to 1st class and would write notes to put me on stand by for 1st available stand by so I could be with my family. When we were boarding I asked about my stand by and he said there were no notes and he had no authorization so he called and she had left for day, so manager lied to us! Also we had paid extra to have seats together which now were not together and were told we would get refunded that extra, on our statement they refunded and then recharged again so in truth there was no refund! They took no responsibility and had the worst customer service. They were very rude to us after they inconvenienced us.

I had a flight from SFO (San Francisco) to CMH (Columbus), with a connection at DFW (Dallas). The layover between two flights was about 1 and half of hour. The first flight had about 1 and half of hour delay, and technically I couldn't make it to the next flight. However, I decided to ask AA staff to make sure about it. I asked them twice, and both times they told me ""you will definitely make it"", and ""we already made some arrangements in this regard"". When I got to DFW airport, my connecting flight was already left, and the next flight was in 12 hours (that is, the next morning). After realizing this, I decided to talk to AA Customer Service at DFW airport, and ask them for a place to spend the night. However, they told me your flight is not eligible for such an offer. So, they made me to stay at airport for 12 hours, without any accommodation. They technically treated me like a baggage. The day after this experience, I decided to contact AA to fill a complain and ask them for refund or something. However, their answer was: ""we are sorry and will try to make it better the next time"". Obviously, they really don't care, and they just want to make as much money as they can with the least quality of service or customer support!";NEGATIVE

They are not fit to be in the service industry as they lack compassion towards their customers. The supervisor at the airport did not allow me to get past the security line as my bag was 1 inch over the bag size allowed. He said ""I have to stand here all day if I have to deal with customers like you"". I had a basic economy ticket that allowed one bag under the seat and my bag fit perfectly under the seat as I have traveled on different other airlines with this bag placed under the seat. They made me pay for the bag and did not allow me to board. When called customer service for the refund of bag fee which I did not even check in, she was highly disrespectful to my request. American Airlines needs to train their employees about basic things like being polite, considerate and accommodating to customer needs and not forget that each customer has paid for the service. They displayed sheer cheapness at the airport!";NEGATIVE

Seats were Ok, pretty standard and IFE was also standard. Nothing special but Ok. The Seat configuration was 2-4-2 and I sat on 27A. 20 minutes into the flight they had to restart the IFE because it was overheating. After 30 minutes of waiting, it could be used again. Another technical issue I noticed was that the USB ports didn´t work, which was pretty annoying since I had a layover. However the IFE was pretty good. Especially there were so many good movies available that was incredible. Of course you had a moving map, TV Series etc. About 2h into the flight the crew served some food. As i sat on the back of the plane there was only 1 food option left, which was a Shepherd pie, it was  delicious. It came  with some salad, a bread bun and a cherry cake. The crew distributed drinks. After main course the crew dimmed the lights and we had to close our window shades. Shortly before landing the crew served either a Vanilla - or a spinach wrap with drinks. My layover in PHL was tiring but ok. At the gate there was no agent for a long time even at boarding time. So we had about 20-30 minutes delay, which was ok but I didnt´t knew the reason. As the flight from PHL-DCA is only 30 minutes long there was no service.

At the boarding gate, passengers we're asked at the last minute to check in their carry-on bags since the overhead bins were reportedly full, but upon boarding there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. I was left saddled with a lot of extra weight during my layover due to the items that I had to remove from my carry-on because they were too fragile and valuable to leave in a checked bag. Very inconvenient. When I bought my ticket it said one carry-on bag was permitted per passenger. Why did I not get what I paid for when there was in fact lots of room in the overhead bins? American Airlines continues to take advantage of paying customers raising the cost of travel while decreasing the quality of the flight experience. Not the first time this has happened.";NEGATIVE

I received notice my flight was going to be delayed 3.5 hrs causing my connecting flight booking to be changed. The problem is I paid for round trip first class tickets 3 months ago. However Due to this delay my flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Ontario was cancelled and I was put on a different flight. Come to find out, my new flight is not in first class even though I paid for first class. So, I contacted the airline thinking it was a mistake. The first time I called I spoke with a lady who did not provide her name. She bluntly told me ""Due to the delay in Knoxville your flight was cancelled and you wont be in first class"". I told her that was unacceptable and I was mad, at that point she hung up on me. I called back, was hung up on again! I called back extremely upset by this point and got a gentlemen who  told the same thing the first lady told me and that the only way the airline would consider giving me a refund was to file a claim with the airline.  Why should I be punished after paying for services not rendered. I am 6 foot 5 inches, I always fly first class. I have flown many other Airlines and I prefer Delta, I had to fly American because this was business. But I can tell you I am never flying american again.";NEGATIVE

They are rude and obnoxious about it and like I said before they are messy. Having to check a bag isn’t the most annoying part, what is annoying is the fact that they make you run around looking for your bag because they can’t figure out where to put them. On top of that annoyance after a long trip that was made longer by stops is the fact that bathrooms where made for 5 years olds. Even a thin person can’t stand over the toilet properly.

Secondly on our flight back our seats were 6a and 6b and by the time they got around to us they had no more food. Totally not acceptable. Thirdly we were guaranteed a stay in premium lounge and upon landing we were told that Cuzamel is unfortunately the only country that was excluded. That took me over the edge.

american-airlines;2018-08-23;" |  In flying from Sacramento to Kansas City through Phoenix, (Date: 8/12/18) our flight was delayed by an hour and a half which forced us to miss our connecting flight in Phoenix. We immediately went to speak to an American Airlines representative, who told us that they were likely not going to be able to get us into Kansas City that evening. What they could do is get us into Phoenix, to which they could put us up in a hotel for the night, and we could fly out the next day (the 13th). Seeing this was only realistic option we had we agreed to stay in Phoenix for the night. As we waited on the flight to arrive from its delay, once we got on the plane, the flight was then again delayed, this time due to weather in Phoenix. After about 20 minutes the flight was then cancelled. We got in line to talk with another American Airlines representative to see what we would need to do for a hotel reservation to stay in Sacramento for the night, as we clearly were not getting into Phoenix. We were then told that they were not responsible for hotel accommodations due to inclement weather. Had we known that the flight to Phoenix was going to have weather trouble we would have taken the flight into Charlotte, or we could have looked at another Airline flight. I asked if I could speak to a manager and the representative told me I would need to go online to file a complaint.. The Customer Service Representative wouldn't even sit us together on our flights for the next day. We were assigned separated seats and when we asked if we could sit together, we were told that we would have to pay a premium for upgraded seats (There were multiple open seats at that time, many of which were not first class). All and all we spent about 7 hours in the airport that day We both ended up having to take an additional day of work We had to pay someone to watch our animals for an additional day We had to pay for a hotel in Sacramento We had to pay for dinner, breakfast, and lunch before we got to fly out the next day (8/13) We had to pay for transportation to the hotel from the airport And we had to pay for an additional day of parking in Kansas City On top of all of this. I have had to call and plead my case (three separate calls) to American Airlines ""Customer Service"" for over two hours on the phone. I have spoken to three different “Customer Service Reps” and 2 different managers. After a week of not hearing from American Airlines I decided to call back. This time I was told that they could not find the complaint that had been filed by Lou and that if I had a formal complaint I would need to file it with the online form (https://www.aa.com/contact/forms?topic=CR#/). This whole ordeal has cost me an insurmountable amount of time and stress at my job to take care of, almost 3 hours I have been on the phone. On top of it all, I had a device (Nintendo switch) that fell out of my laptop bag on the flight home, valued over $400, now lost. I have notified American Airlines of the lost item as well, both in Phoenix and Kansas City, to which both referred me to the online portal to submit for lost items. I will not being flying with American Airlines ever again, and I will be sure that my company, colleagues, and family are informed on how poorly this company treats their customers for when they decide to make future travel arrangements.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-08-23;" |  New York to Dallas Ft Worth. My flight with another airline was cancelled last minute due to weather. so, I booked a one-way ticket with AA for the following day using the miles I had been saving for years and paid the $75 fee to do so. After waiting on the runway for almost 3 hours, we were told we had to return to the gate to refuel. however, once at the gate, we were finally told that the flight was cancelled and passengers were told to deplane and figure it out with the gate agent. The next flight AA could get me on was the following day at 6pm, so I waited in line for 3 more hours to obtain a travel voucher for one night stay (would you want your wife or daughter sleeping alone in LaGuardia Airport?) But to my surprise, I was told by the AA gate agent, who was seemingly extremely exhausted and overwhelmed, that AA no longer issued travel vouchers and that would have to instead submit a post-flight reimbursement claim at AA.com/customerrelations, including all receipts for hotel, food and transportation. As you can already guess, my request was denied, stating that it is not AA's 'approach to offer compensation for ATC delays', plus a bunch of other highly-pacifist lip service. My frustration and reason for this review is not due to my time being wasted on a runway for 3 hours or even for the flight being cancelled. My frustration is due to the fact that an AA employee lied directly to my face about AA no longer issuing travel vouchers (since apparently they do still offer voucher for cancelled flights) knowing damn-well I would not be reimbursed. So, on top of the miles and fee I paid to use those miles that I'd already spent thousands of dollars on to obtain, I'm out an additional $470 bc their employee lied to me. Had I known this, I would have demanded a voucher or a solution for where to sleep. ";NEGATIVE

If they spoke to me out in the street or on the sidewalk like that they wouldn’t walk away with their front teeth intact, but since they work for an airline I have to be polite.

However, as I sit on yet another delayed flight I have decided that this will be my last trip with American. In the 20 legs between Dallas and Denver I have flown with American I have been delayed on 14 of them. Most of these delays were not weather related.

My wife and I booked a flight from Boston to Montana, and on the flight down we had missed our connecting flight due to the pilot leaving ten minutes early. No big deal, things happen, we understand that. One the flight back, it was delayed repeatedly, being pushed back from 8 pm to 1 am, and then finally canceled. Come to find out the next flight isn't until the following day at 5:30 pm. I spoke to a rep trying to get on an earlier flight, and while he was helpful he was unable to provide any other alternatives. I requested to speak to a supervisor who might be able to pull some strings. Now, up until this point, I was respectful, and while aggravated, attempted as much as possible not to project that aggravation, as I know he was doing his best. I have worked in a call center before, and I know how aggravating it can be to be someones personal punching bag. However, once on the line with this agent, my complaint changed from one of unfortunate circumstance to one of complete disbelief that American Airlines can be so callous towards customers. The supervisor was condescending, patronizing, and insulting from the very opening of the call. She pronounced my name with blatant disgust and ensured to pronounce hers with an air of authority that indicated I should feel graced by the fact that she took a few minutes out of her important schedule to speak to me. She belittled my concerns, refused to offer any recourse whatsoever, or apologies for inconveniences, and basically openly insulted me when I implied that the airline with the flight I was trying to get on was American Airlines, as opposed to being an opposing airlines flight. When I called her out on this by asking her if she found it acceptable to speak to me with a condescending and patronizing tone of voice was to talk over me, loudly telling me that she was not doing that, and then to proceed to disconnect my phone call in the middle of my sentence. I called back, and requested to speak to a supervisor in regards to my experience with a customer service rep. She patched me through to a representative in the same position, that informed me that she doesn't know who she is, and I can't file a complaint through her or speak to anyone who can record a complaint against her, as they are an email only department. After about 15 minutes of going around in circles with her, I wrote out a detailed email to the department I was told to reach out to, and received a cookie cutter type response offering insincere apologies and offering no recourse whatsoever. The agent and my experience with American Airlines has left me in complete disbelief that a company can operate with such indecent practices, and offer no remorse whatsoever or even a token apology to make the situation a little more bearable. I understand that some things, especially weather, are out of a companies control, but the callous disregard they have for the inconvenience that their customers are put through as well as the disrespectful way that their customer service handles the situation are completely unacceptable. There is a lot more to the story that I am unable to add due to the character limit, but I hope that my poor experience will serve to warn people away from this horrible company.";NEGATIVE

They wouldn’t allow overhead access which is a new rule but it can go under your seat. I applied by this rule. As I’m boarding the plane they told me I had to check my bag and couldn’t board with it. This is absolutely bogus. I had to complain to them to let me bring my bag on. They told me there wasn’t anymore overhead bin room. Great, I get that, but mine fits under the seat as I premeasured my bag. They said they didn’t care, they didn’t have overhead bin access so I had to check my bag. I told them I understand that there isn’t but mine fits under my seat. They then tried to say that it didn’t matter because I had two bags, the second being my purse... since when do purses count? But that could also fit in my bag so i put my purse in my bag. They eventually let me take my bag (which comfortably fit under my seat) but I had to complain to them more than enough times.

My younger sister and I got to our first gate no problem where they spent 20 minutes begging people to check luggage causing the line to back up. The plane took off late. We thought it wasn’t a huge deal because we had time between flights. Both flights were booked through American which I thought would make them a little more aware of delays with other planes. Myself and 6 other very kind people missed our connecting flight to Hartford all on the same plane. We landed and sat on the ground for 25-30 minutes “waiting for a gate and crew.” They closed our flight because we got off the plane too late by no fault of our own. They then sent us to customer service where we waited in line for about 40 minutes for them to tell us the only other flight to Hartford was at 7:30 am the next morning where we again would have to get on a connecting flight in Chicago. The people were terribly rude at the desk where they then told us it wasn’t their fault and we would have to cover all our room costs to stay the night in Dallas. Flights are not cheap making this service completely inexcusable. It would be a whole different thing if this was an inexpensive product. My sister and I ended up pooling all our traveling money together to spend $90 to stay in a room over night. I wish I could give them zero stars. To be fair our flight there was not something to complain about, but they have lost my business forever. Not to mention all the other people on my same flight who missed their connecting flights.  With this first hand experience I would never recommend American Airlines to anyone who would prefer to not be treated like a piece of luggage themselves.

However, things did not go as planned when my Kansas flight got diverted from Chicago to Madison, Wisconsin due to a storm. Since then, it has been nothing but a nightmare and dissatisfaction with American airlines. In Madison, I waited in line for over three hours along with other passengers to make travel arrangements and hotel reservations. I was the last person to leave the airport, around 2:30am on June 11. The AA staff then assured me that he made my reservations and had rebooked all of my flights through the rest of my international, arrangement. He printed me the boarding pass to Chicago and also to Paris. He informed me to come back in the morning to check-in my bag and sent me off to a hotel. Well, I was back by 9:30am at the airport to start my journey. I checked in and got my boarding passes to Chicago and to Paris. However, the staff informed me that since they made my connections through Delta, they wouldn’t be able to print the boarding pass from Paris to Jordan and that I would have to do that in Paris when I landed. However, they assured me that all is good and that my bag, has a label to AMM. it will continue to Amman.

My supposed flight to Jordan was going to leave around 3pm. So, I ran to get to terminal 2E. I did get there, but I needed a boarding pass to cross through security. First, I tried the kiosks, but was not successful. I talked to an Air France person who informed me there was something wrong with my booking and that I needed to speak with Air France customer service. Luckily, it was just a few feet away. however, the line was 100 feet long. So, I waited in line for 90 minutes. When I got to the customer service representative, they informed me that my reservation was not done correctly by AA and it was cancelled. They told me that the plane to Jordan was full. The representative also said that I would need to talk to American Airlines to fix their mistake and rebook me on another flight. This meant, I had to run back to terminal 2A. I did run to Terminal 2A to find AA counters closed for the day as their last flight was leaving. Luckily, there was somebody trying to get to the locked office who agreed to try to help. Now it was past 1pm, 3 hours after I arrived and I didn’t know if I would ever leave the airport and join my family who travelled one day before me on Sat. Thinking I will be joining them just a day later. It is now 2 days later and God knows where my bag is now.

We asked to check in one of the children’s cabin baggage and were instructed that this would cost a further $100 as 7 albeit light bags had been checked in.

Needless to say I was very upset and made a formal request begging for a 3 day extension in order to uae my almost $2,100 credit and this is the message I just received 3 days after my request. I'm sorry that you didn't travel with us as planned nor were you able to use the value of your unused tickets within a year. We know that travel doesn't always happen as planned, which is why we give our customers one year from the date the original ticket was issued to begin new travel. We believe that offering a full year to rebook travel provides our customers the flexibility they need to use their flight credit. I'm sorry for any disappointment we might cause by declining your request. Let me assure you that our position does not lessen our regard for you as our customer. It is always our pleasure to serve you, and I hope that we have the opportunity to welcome you aboard again soon. This is the same as stealing!!!

I cannot express enough how much I have come to hate this airline over the years. Just when you think they cannot make you dislike them any more - they find new ways to underdeliver without the smile. While rolling eyes. They have classes on weekends on how to sigh, be useless and insulting at the same time while accomplishing nothing. Oh! And the gate changes. Do not forget the last minute never ending gate changes. Then suddenly the person that was just your gate agent 30 seconds ago, where you have been dutifully and patiently standing, will weasel their way out of helping you.

I waited two whole hours in line with Zero customer care or attention. Finally I was told that the only flight would take me to Montreal is in the afternoon and then I would arrive at 11.30 PM. I did not trust the agent and I talked to another agent who re-booked me via PHL at 10:50 AM and departure being at 8:50 PM from PHL meaning my arrival to Montreal would be almost Midnight. While waiting at the airport I called the customer person and she was kind enough to book me at 6:00 pm (so I gained 2 hours by talking to this person.) Then when I arrived to PHL I walked to customer service department and they put me on flight at 3:00 PM. This is the worst airline and the customer support out for Norfolk was disgusting for them to send passengers home saying there was no flight available, it was not true. IF I was able to get on a flight to Montreal later in the afternoon why was this entire booking not done earlier. The airline has the responsibility to train their agents at the ticket counter and to also train them for being compassionate and understanding and to try their hardest to get people home. on a scale of 1 to 10 (being high ), I will give American airline and its agents zero. Horrible experience and it was unnecessarily delayed. ";NEGATIVE

We had to stay overnight in NY at our own expense and spend more the $300.00 not including the taxi fare to and from the Hotel. This is not the first time it has happened in our previous trip also.

I was supposed to depart Miami, FL at 8:34am and arrive in Boston at 11:51am, where my ride would be waiting. I was notified at 5:18am that my flight had been delayed and we would depart at 7:30am, thereby making me miss my connecting flight in Miami. There was no reason given for delay. Then I was notified at 6:22am that the flight was cancelled. No reason given. I was to be rebooked on a flight that would arrive in Boston at 12:47am the following morning. I let the desk agent at Gainesville know this would not work for me. They rebooked my flight from the Orlando airport to Charlotte, NC and the soonest they could get me in would be 5:11pm to Boston. They sent me on a shuttle to the Orlando airport where we were delayed yet again taking off. We were delayed 30 minutes in Charlotte, then sat on the tarmac for 2 hours. It was awful. I ended up arriving into Boston at 8pm. I was tired, upset and had missed my ride. When I tried to get reimbursed for my time and the inconvenience, American Airlines Customer Solutions offered 7500 bonus miles, which is embarrassingly meager and anyway, I wouldn’t fly with them again if they were the last airline available. I was never told why there were so many delays or why my flight was cancelled on August 3rd.

american-airlines;2018-08-09;" |  Paris CDG to New York. A bit of an ""airline-geek"" I used a convenient website to discover that our B767 was 23.7 years old. Traveling International Business, I was hoping that the plane would be retrofitted with modern amenities. Firstly, the Admirals Club at CDG is magnificent - food...liquor, work-space, relaxing areas. this club puts USA clubs to shame! The plane looked old. the bathrooms were atrocious but functioning but, the seats were fantastic. IFE via Samsung tablet was sufficient. First thing I noticed was the myriad of uniforms and attitudes from the 8 flight attendants. Safety is paramount but, service is what can make or break the passenger's perspective. Each FA wore a different uniform, except for the younger staff, who represented the airline with proper etiquette. Tie, no tie, blue shirt, white shirt, grey jersey dress, etc., it was was mix-match that sent an unprofessional message. Sadly the warmth and service suffered from the same issue. The FA in Business Class functioned. There was no extra sense that I was flying in a ""Flagship"" experience. Nothing was offered other than the typical drink, dinner and snack. No walk-through the cabins to offer additional aperitifs or any other needs or niceties. The much boasted wine-pairing was not even mentioned. The main starters were poor. not every one likes cold salmon and celery/radish salad. Main plate was OK, certainly not what I have experienced on other carriers including Delta and Cathay Pacific! Asking for dessert to be offered a little later after lunch, the FA serving the 14 of us conveniently forgot. I did however get a cold cup of coffee after troubling the FA - and that's what I felt, like I was a trouble. I understand that working with the public can be aggravating and perhaps working conditions within the employee union may effect attitude but, the service and food quality was extremely poor. The most gracious staff member on the flight was the Captain who was so appreciative that we chose AA! We arrived safely but the seven hours in air was mediocre and truly representative of a 3 star airline. Hey American why not try for a 4 or 5 star rating. But, that might take a lot of hard work, an attitude change and perhaps a uniform that all can wear and be proud of.";POSITIVE

So I asked to chat with the supervisor who I guess was at the gate, so we proceeded to the gate, we arrived at the gate still with plenty of time to board the plane that we had already been kicked off because the agent was too lazy to check and rush one bag to the plane. As I arrived at the gate I asked for supervisor and when she appeared I asked are you a manager, her response was ""yes I dont have much time what do you want?"" Taken back once again by the courteous and helpful nature of the now management I said ""would you like to wait to chat with me until you have more time?"" She then peered at me with a cold glare and asked me to continue. I explained the attitude I encountered at the front counter she showed no element of caring and proceeded to tell me if I'm not 1.5 hours early there is no guarantee the staff at AA will do their job and get you on the flight. Other passengers were pervy to my conversation and began to share their stories of rude counter staff here today too. As a seasoned traveler I've seen every aspect of good and bad customer service is this is terrible. Many airlines will bend over backwards to get you on you flights knowing that sometimes we (customers) run a little behind and sometimes you (airlines) run behind and the end goal is transported happy customers.

Soon later, they made everyone get off of the plane because it was too hot on the plane and the air conditioner wasn’t effective, and they ran out of drinking water. We get off of the plane and wait for an update. No accurate update was given. We were simply told that the weather was bad and that now our Captain can’t fky because he’s over his time. They called several more captains and it was too late for them all to fly. They finally found a captain that Can fly. We get back in the plane, which was crammed. We waited almost an hour. I asked the flight attendant what was going on and what time we were taking off. She said she did not know. I asked for water because it was very hot and was told they ran out still. So we were going to be on a 3 hour flight with no water. Soon later, we all get texts that our flight was cancelled. We asked the flight attendant and they had no information. Finally we were told by the captian that it was cancelled. It was past 12am at this point. It took forever for them to re-in-board the plane. We finally get off and get directed to the reservation area by an AA employee by the name of Ana.Short Spanish looking lady.With no patience, she very rudely screams at us while swinging her finger in our face, to get in a single file line and “don’t even think about cutting”.It’s not like she made that comment before and people ignored her.

The only snack your offered are pretzels. I also didn't get my bag about 12 to 12:30. The constant delays were unreal. I didn't get settled at home until 1:30 in the morning, which caused problems for me the next day. Then when I opened my luggage the next day it was clear that my luggage was handled extremely poorly. I wrapped a glass picture frame in clothes so it wouldn't get damaged in flight as I've done before with delta without a fragile sticker being placed on it and with delta it would always be fine, when I opened my bag the frame was shattered and the broken glass had ruined my picture. There was also a 10min delay getting off of the plane. Then when I went to the train to go to baggage claim, the train was very slow, not just arriving to pick us up at the gate, but moving to baggage claim.

At that moment, the flight was still supposed to fly at 10 pm, so I decided to stick to it and I checked my suitcase in. After that, they keep sending the delay notifications, which ended up saying ""the flight was cancelled and your new flight is 5:25 am one"" As expected, they never provided any reasons at all and I was kicked out of the security area around 12am, which forced me to spend some 4 hours outside and come back to line up for the security again around 4 am. When I asked about my suitcase I checked in at the gate after this reschedule, the crew said ""that is a separated system and we have no information."" The new flight departed without any trouble and I got my suitcase at Philly airport, which was the only good news. After I came back home, I posted a complaint through their system, which is not responded at all for more than 2 days.

I end up calling customer service and they had to update the meal preference. However they miss updating one of the family members and guess what, 2 Asian vegetarian meals for 3 of us.  I was traveling with an infant, so requested a bassinet almost 2 months in advance. Even called the customer service and I get a standard response that I need to request at the airport. I am a platinum pro traveler and I still could not block any bulkhead rows because I had a lap child in the reservation. I go to the airport 3.5 hours before the departure time and request bassinet. I was told that I need to contact the gate agent. I go ask the gate agent and she tells me that no bulk head seats are available as all of those seats were sold at a premium to other passengers. When I checked out those seats, there were no infants in them. This was a shocker. My next 2 legs were with Etihad and they had the bulk head rows assigned to us even before requesting them. The air hostesses were arrogant and would not like to entertain simple questions like “hey do have some fruits for the kids?” I specifically asked for the name to complain and she would not divulge her name. A simple yes or know would have sufficed but all I get is ""Why are you bothering me"" look. This kind of behavior deters families traveling with American and could cost in the long run. No point in whining about Middle East airlines capturing the international travel market. Not because of their price but because of their service.

What happened next is beyond irritating. On Wednesday we boarded the plane in Newport News and was later deplaned due to a brake issue. They rescheduled our flights for the next day and changed our location to an airport 45 minutes away (Norfolk, VA). On Thursday, they canceled our flight again stating that there was no crew to fly the plane out of Norfolk. So in the end we got to Hawaii on Friday, three days later, a shortened vacation and the worst part, we missed my niece’s wedding! What do you think they did to compensate us? Keep in mind between my husband and myself we sent American five emails regarding this situation. Their solution, give us 15,000 miles! Really, who would want to fly with them after this.

Boarded the plane and pulled away from gate only to find out twenty minutes in that we needed air pressure and a boost and we waited 3 hours with no air in 100 degree weather in Miami just for mechanics to come fix the problem that they said was no big deal. Then we had to wait about an extra hour for a push car to come push the plane and only the crew shows up without the starter car! Had to wait another half hour for them to find the car . And all this we were only told 2.5 hours in that we may leave the plane but the kicker is they were not giving back luggage and were putting whoever wanted to leave on standby to wait whenever they decide to give you another flight. They said it could be tonight tomorrow or next week. How convenient. Who is going to go anywhere without their luggage? Basically didn’t make sense for anyone to leave so we had no choice. On top of all that the flight attendants were the laziest I ever met. I am 6 months pregnant with an 8 month old baby. We were both sweating and overheated. My baby couldn’t even eat it was so hot for her and I asked one for water about an hour in and she pointed to her metal cabinet draws where the water is. Was I supposed to get it myself ? Who knows. I had to start crying to finally get water. Then they said that maybe they should start giving out some water. Maybe? Is that a joke. People are dehydrating. When my husband asked one for iced water she just stared at him with a blank face she only got it once he yelled and then she got mad he yelled ! They only started giving out water about two hours in and had to ration it because they ran out. People had connecting flights in JFK that they missed and you would think they gate manager would help them reschedule or provide them with a compensation but no. Our only compensation was a movie and 1 pack of cookies. I could go on and on. So unprofessional so lazy so incompetent. They should be out of business and should be ashamed of themselves;NEGATIVE

I got to the airport for a 5am flight at 2:30am, and was bumped off the next 7 flights. I had to take a vacation day from work because I couldn’t get back in time. There was no communication and they couldn’t ensure that I get back because “that’s just the standby game.” Well, if I am still a paying customer, and if I’ve been sitting here for 14 hours then I should be treated as such. After the 5th missed flight, I finally folded and bought a ticket myself ($65) so I could get home. Since I bought this ticket the morning of, I was on boarding group 9. This means that you’re only allowed one personal item which was never conveyed to me. Even though my bag was carry-on size, I had to pay $50 for them to check my bag as I was boarding because I was in group 9 and that’s not allowed apparently, and they were out of room in the overhead storage bins since THEY oversold the flight. None of which, by the way was my fault.  Use another airline.";NEGATIVE

Things got better from there. The new 737MAX has great overhead bins and lighting, the First Class seat was honestly not as comfortable as the previous 737-8's were, particularly in full recline. You feel like you need a big pillow in the small of your back to give some lumbar support. Pitch was fine. The FA were gracious and smiling, and always checking on the customers. They were really great. PDB was offered to all 16 F passengers. Meal service was excellent, served polite and efficiently. I got beef with quinoa and asparagus, the beef was tender and red in the middle. Salad and choice of roll and warm cookie too!

american-airlines;2018-07-04;" |  Denver to Gatwick via Orlando. Worst experience, will not do it again. I was flying unaccompanied with a toddler on this trip. I intentionally booked flights that had a couple layovers thinking it would give the baby the opportunity to get out and about to do something else on a long journey. These layovers is where all the trouble started. Flew from Denver to North Carolina and made the connection without a hitch. Then from North Carolina to Orlando before heading to London. My flight coming into Orlando arrived late. By the time I was able to de-board the plane my connection was boarding in another terminal, completely on the other side of the airport where I had to leave and re-enter security to get there. Since I was carrying a 30+ lb. Toddler and a 15+ lb carseat I tried to ask for help to get where I needed to go quickly. The gate agents response (at every stop) was it's faster just to do it yourself.  So nowI sprint across all of the Orlando airport get to security only to find the boarding passes they sent me for my British Airways connection don't work. Security tells me I have to go to the ticket counter to get new passes .my flight is boarding as we speak. I run to the ticket counter, loaded down with baby & her stuff to find no one at the counter. Talk to the American Airlines representative (flight is booked as american airlines, operated as british airways) to be informed they can't do anything they will have to see if there is someone around for British Airways. Find someone, get my boarding pass, make it through security get on the plane with 3 minutes to spare. Coming back was worse. Flight out of Florida was delayed 2 hours causing me to miss my connection. After flying 9 hours with a toddler, going through customs in and out of security and hauling around all the baby gear they wanted to put me on a connecting flight to get home the following moring! Finally found 1 gate agent who sympathized and managed to get me the last 2 seats on the last flight that night. However. when arriving for my connection in Dallas they changed the arrival gate to another terminal completely across the airport. Once again the connection was boarding, asked gate agents for help to get across the airport quickly and was told it was faster to do it myself. RAN with toddler and accessories across all of DFW. As a mother of 3, two who are now grown I remember gate agents and airport staff being much more helpful with families flying with young children. Apparently preboarding for parents flying with young children doesn't exist to this airline anymore. When I asked the rep almost laughed at me. It only makes sense so that parents can get kids settled and out of the way of other boarding passengers. Instead I got to stand in the isle, hold up traffic flow and apologize repeatedly to everyone around me while I tried to get the baby in. On the flight back from London to Florida (9 hours) the movies on my daughter TV didn't work and they couldn't do anything to fix it. I  could not get wifi to entertain her. The whole travel part of the trip was a complicated mess. On the other side my husband and older daughter where flying on another airline at the same time and arrived everywhere they where going early.";NEGATIVE

I’ve had my share of bad travel experiences and it’s often I compelled me to write nasty reviews, so it’s only fair that when I have a really great experience I write a fitting review as well. Classic situation- our flight from Rome to Philadelphia (AA 719) was delayed for about two hours, which caused us to miss our connecting flight (with Dreaded Delta) from Philadelphia to our home in Detroit . Very rarely does this pan out in the travelers favor. Great customer service isn’t born by perfection. not every flight is on time, and mistakes are made. Great customer service is all about making it right. Like all travelers in this situation, I just wanted to get home and that’s exactly what happened. American ended up booking us on a full flight about an hour after our original flight into Detroit, causing minimal inconvenience. Free of charge. Technically speaking I think AA had no obligation to do this and that Delta, if anyone, would have issued us new tickets (and no, we did not have insurance). Beyond that, I have to say that the staff of flight AA 719 was the most professional, pleasant and fun crew I have been around over probably a hundred flights. Both the staff on the flight and the representatives I spoke to on the phone (especially supervisor Leslie) were extremely helpful and understanding of our situation. They had rules and protocol and they broke them to help us — they treated us like individuals and not like numbers. That is the hallmark of a class organization. Generally speaking, when I select flights I’m looking more for price and timing. In the future I’m going to lean towards American Airlines. We could very easily have missed our flight, bought new tickets, hotel accommodations, a last second extra day off work, etc — that happens to people every day.

Then we got sent to another aircraft because apparently the one we were originally didn’t pass the test when it should’ve been tested beforehand. While we are waiting on the second flight after 4 hours of waiting then the crew disappears and we have not pilot. I completely understand that incidents happen if it’s a weather condition, or even if there is something wrong with the aircraft.

He said the only way I could board the flight was to pay $250. I said I would if this would help expedite and we could sort it out later. Then he told me then I would need a dog carrier to board the plane, which I didn't have as this wasn't required for emotional support animals. I told him this was not right, I had followed the online requirements and showed him my AA form and my emails with the SAC (Special Assistance Coordinator). I asked him to call his supervisor, which he did. All of this took about 30 minutes. Now the plane was fully boarded and he was not going to let me on this flight. Seconds before the flight left, finally his supervisor agreed I could get on the plane.

Our flight was from Phoenix to Fresno was cancelled, when we asked about our options the staff was rude and said we be put on stand by for the next flight which was later that night. We had children at home and our sitter was leaving the next day so we had to get home, so being put on stand by with 100 other people was not an option for us. So we rented a car and drove for 9 hours. When we emailed the airline (there is no phone number to call according to the staff) they said we ""elected"" to take a car and they would not reimburse us. The refund for the ticket didn't even cover the cost of the car (because it was from a different state). We tried calling the reservation hot line and the women we talked to stay we wasted their time by calling. She actually said we wasted her time. Please do not fly with them. They are rude and unprofessional and you might not even get where you need to.";NEGATIVE

My flight from Chicago O'Hare Airport to Wilmington, NC was delayed four times (which is not the problem). The flight was eventually cancelled, I have never had to deal with a cancelled flight before but I know it happens, so the staff should know how to handle these situations. I couldn't be more wrong. After standing in the customer service line for 40 minutes, I was handed a piece of paper with an 800 number on it, to then sit on hold for another hour, only to be told I would be issued a refund, or I could wait until the next day for a flight to my destination. I was traveling alone with my 7 Month old baby, and had only her diaper bag of limited supplies. The staff was absolutely useless, and very rude. One staff member rolled her eyes at me, and another man said to me, ""I can't control the airline, it's really not my problem."" I have never received such horrible customer service and this is absolutely unacceptable. I had to come up with different options for the staff to work with me, essentially doing their job. I ended up having to go through United Airlines to get to my destination, and their staff was very helpful.

american-airlines;2018-06-28;" |  Arrived at curbside check in at 5:30 am for a 6:43 departure (Tampa to Greensboro, via Charlotte. Then later that afternoon I was scheduled to leave Greensboro on a direct flight to Philadelphia and returning to Tampa the following day). Stand at curbside for ten minutes or so waiting for “computer problems” to be resolved so I can check my one bag. Finally gave up and went inside. Stood in that line for I guess another fifteen minutes or so because by the time it was my turn I was one minute ... yes, one minute inside the 45 minute cutoff to check a bag. What ensued over the next ten or fifteen minutes is not even worth going into, but suffice it to say that due to the ineptitude and uncaring of this “customer service representative” and his even more inept and uncaring supervisor, I missed a domestic flight I arrived an hour and fifteen minutes early for and was put on standby for the next one which was going to get me in an hour later than my first meeting was scheduled to start. While waiting on standby at the gate, I happened to start chatting with a girl sitting next to me, and turns out she is an AA employee’s daughter, and tells me somewhat sheepishly that it is AA policy to overbook every flight by at least five seats and their workaround is that any preferred status members who want on a flight can get on because they will work the system to get idiots like me who had the audacity to want to check a piece of luggage to “miss” their flight by milking the clock and then invoking FAA regulations. By some miracle, I did get on the standby flight, made it to Charlotte and on to Greensboro and went to baggage claim to get my bag. Guess what? No bag. A patently disinterested, gum-popping employee in the baggage office told me that my bag had been checked on to Philadelphia because “this isn’t where you are actually going.” Oh no? Then why am I here now? Too much in a hurry to worry about it, I left to get to what was left of my meetings and returned to the airport in Greensboro. With time in hand before my flight I decided to check and see if a different employee might have some other info about the bag containing my meeting clothes and other necessities for my meeting the following morning that I now hadn’t seen for almost twelve hours. This woman, who was actually nice enough, unlike everyone else I had dealt with so far, proceeded to tell me in about 0.2 seconds that yes, in fact, my bag was already in Philadelphia. The amazing part was that she hadn’t looked at my baggage claim ticket or touched her computer so I guess she was a psychic? Apparently a bad one, however, because when pressed she admitted she had no basis for that claim and decided maybe sne should call someone (never did say who or where) and double check, at which point she says that in fact my bag has very considerately been held here for me in Greensboro and will be joining me on the plane to Philadelphia. Super. Only guess what? I land in Philadelphia and there is no bag waiting for me there, so once again I head for the baggage office of AA. Luck happened to be with me this time and I happened to get helped by a wonderful person named Zakiyah who patiently worked to disentangle all of the lies, ineptitude and misinformation that had been dogging my poor little suitcase all day long and finally deduced that it had been taken off the plane and put on the wrong conveyor in another terminal and was revolving forlornly on a conveyor belt a few buildings over";NEGATIVE

Wasting an entire day both days continuing to say we were going only to not board when we could’ve arrived later and done something besides wait at an airport holding my luggage. The absolute worst airline I have flown in my life. The rage is literally boiling over. Im looking at day 3 of all day excuses for why American Airlines can’t manage to get a single airplane on time to their correct destination. I’ve used my own extra resources for extra rides to the airport to pick up luggage that was sent to the wrong airport and they couldn’t get in until the next day, for extra Lyft rides because of their continued incompetence.

Feel free to call customer service or come up to this desk to be moved to a stand by list for another flight."" I looked at my wife questioningly. Had they really just said that? I looked at the crowd of people now hopping to their feet. We spent the day rushing from gate to gate trying to catch flights on a standby list with sixty other people from a cancelled flight. Why hadn't they just waited for another plane and delayed our flight two hours instead of having us run from gate to gate trying vainly to catch flights that were always overbooked? As we waited we heard stories of other cancellations, horrendous customer service, and an overall lack of any sympathy from American Airlines for the trouble they were causing their customers. ""I'm not going to book with American Airlines again."" I told my wife. She agreed that we should try to avoid it. On our way back to Spokane our plane was delayed two hours without explanation. ""Our plane has just landed and is unloading now."" the gate attendant announced to us, half an hour prior to scheduled boarding. Three and a half hours later we finally got on the plane. We were in the last group to board and we sat in a stationary plane for another half hour before it moved at all.

Apart from the fact that she spoke to me in a very disrespectful manner, she also attended another group of 30 while she was helping me out. I also overheard one of the guys working in the counter telling a customer that the flight was already packed, so I am assuming that the reason why they were not letting me attend my flight was be cause my flight was oversold.

american-airlines;2018-06-25;" |  Miami to Minneapolis. This was my first and last time flying American Airlines. I was scheduled to depart from MIA Friday at 5:40pm to land in Charolette where I then had a direct flight back to MSP. My scheduled arrival time in MSP was 12:20am Saturday. We started the boarding process where group 1 was starting to board. Then an announcement was made that there was a flat tire on the plane and they needed an hour to replace the tire. Half hour later we had a weather delay, no big deal its weather not their fault. After the weather cleared the work on the tire never started and another announcement was made that they needed an hour to fix the tire. These series of delays caused connection issues with other travelers and my connection was now in jepordy. After the repairs were made and driving around on the runway we finally departed at 9:40pm. We landed in Charolette around 1045pm, my flight to MSP left 20 min before I landed. After talking with an employee about needing to get home I had to spend the night in a questionable hotel that American Airlines paid for and gave me a $12 meal voucher. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30am (Same time I should have landed back home). Instead of having a direct flight from CLT to MSP I had to fly to ORD at 9:40am then land at MSP by 3:05pm. No issues flying to ORD (I was shocked), but now another issue with the plane. After the plane arrived from Las Vegas we started boarding again by calling group 1 then announcing we had to delay because of fluid leaking in the engine. Another delay of 1 hour. The announced that the plane had to be decommissioned and a new plane had to be brought in as a replacement. We finally took off from ORD around 3pm (Again the same time I should have been home). All the delays and setbacks caused my fees in the parking ramp to skyrocket. My overall experience with American Airlines was horrible. I have never been part of so many delays and questioned the overall safety of planes by one fleet. If a plane landed that had fluid leaking in an engine shouldn't that have set off an alarm? Why would they try and board knowing there was an issue on the plane? Also the on flight entertainment is the same level as Spirit airlines, there is none. Only if you want to burn through you phone battery which is an extremely valuable resource when flying American Airlines and can't call your family to tell them you are delayed...again.

I was to leave at 5:00 on a Friday morning. At 10:30 p.m. on Thursday I get a text that my flight has been cancelled. Of course I immediately call AA and am told it will take one and half to two hours before I even get a return call. I wait for about an hour and try again. Rather than giving me the call back option this time, they recognize my number and ask me to hold. I do so for about 45 minutes. Eventually I get a customer service representative and my only option is to fly out of Tampa airport the next morning. They initially had me rebooked on a 10:30 a.m. Flight from Tampa but by the time I got into Nashville and then drove two hours to where my daughter lives, all of Friday would have been wasted. So I rebooked on a 5:00 a.m. Flight, getting into Nashville at the same time I would have if my Sarasota flight hadn't been cancelled. By this time it's 1:00 or so in the morning. That leaves me about an hour's worth of sleeping time before I have to get up and leave for the Tampa airport. While I made the flight on time and the customer service representative was very helpful in getting me on that flight, the fact remains I had to drive an hour to the airport and park my car whereas if I had left from Sarasota like I normally do, I would have used Uber and not incurred $90 in parking fees (plus two hours of driving time and tolls). American Airlines refuses to reimburse me. If I had missed my flight you can be sure I wouldn't have gotten a refund or any other courtesy. All I want is a refund of the parking fees.

I have flown this airline for over 30 years and they seem to be going downhill in on-time departures, comfort, and service. On my trip from DFW to Paris and the return from Rome, the service was the most apparently lacking. On the outbound they kept announcing another 30 minute delay(mechanical problem in the interior) every half hour for a total 3 hour delay. The ground crew was heard saying they did not have enough maintenance people working on a Sunday afternoon. The dinner service once onboard was rushed and unpleasant and I chalked it up to the late take off. Not so, because the service from the flight attendants on the return trip was just as shabby. FA were unfriendly, unhelpful, and at times rude or condescending towards passengers. They acted as if they did not want to be there doing this job.  I was in the new Premium Economy cabin and paid a lot more than an economy fare for my ticket. I feel the higher cost should include better service, not just a bigger seat. The new Premium Economy passengers had to go sometimes to the very back of the plane and through the galley to use a vacant lavatory. Forget stretching your legs on a long flight by walking to the back as the aisles are so narrow in the Main Cabin one can not avoid bumping seated passengers.There was no offer of refills on the free alcohol drinks. Any question or request was met with an attitude that the FA could not be bothered. I could see that this job may not be the most glamorous, but if you can't or won't do the job, then retire so that someone with a better attitude could take your place.

I offered to drive from Raleigh part way to catch a flight or even drive from outside Chicago a couple hours...if she could just get me close. The response I received was that my request was too difficult and required too much work on her part. I then asked if there was someone else who could help me and she said I was free to go wait in line again for someone else who might be more willing to spend the time assisting me in getting to my destination. (point to note: there was no one behind me in line) I was frustrated and started to break down into tears (that's how important this event was) but all she did was pick at her nail polish and repeat the phrase 'you will not be making it to Chicago by tomorrow morning.' She then proceeded to tell me that I was not eligible for a hotel voucher because I was not based out of Raleigh? Well played. I travel a decent amount and have a lot of patience for people dealing with travel issues. Travel delays happen and I accommodate, but this time I really needed to get somewhere and American Airlines missed the mark. The least she could have done is shown a little compassion but no, I was treated like I was there to serve her needs as she saw fit. Would it have been so hard for her to ask someone else to help me?

We were scheduled to come home at 7:44am from jackson hole with a layover in Dallas and then land in Austin at 1:38pm needless to say I paid extra money for this flight for the short trip time. We got a notification the night before that our flight would be delayed till 11:30am and we had to switch our connecting flight and us land in Austin after 5pm. It wasn’t even 30 min before flight was supposed to board that they tell us oh no you won’t be departing till 8:20pm! I am pregnant with twins now having to sit in the airport for 8 hours. I went up to the counter to ask if there was any way to get us home sooner that I was pregnant with twins and in need of getting home sooner because have a doctors appointment and the lady was so rude said ma’am I can’t help you go sit down. The people working the counter of American Airlines did not tell us we had to go back out to get our bags then go through the line again to check them we all had to figure that out so when others were saying that’s what we had to do I went to the counter to ask and the man told me “the bags arnt going to check themselves” are you kidding me? Then I over heard how some ladies got food vouchers which we did not. So I had to go to front desk and they sent me on wild goose chase for the vouchers with a whole whopping $24 for two people! After I got the vouchers I had to go back through security once again. This has been the worst experience I have ever had with any airline and I refuse to ever fly with them again and I suggest to anyone taking the time to read this to not fly with them they are the most inconvenient airline ever and do not make adjustments to their delays or issues.

Flight attendants were rude, disinterested, and seemed like they hated being there. As I went to the back of the plane often to stretch my legs, I would hear the flight attendants saying nasty things about passengers. They hardly paid any attention to the passengers except what they were absolutely required to do, spending much of their time gossiping and goofing off in the back. I flew British Airways on the way there and the contrast is astounding. BA is far more professional and courteous to their passengers. Then once in DFW to make a connection, I spoke with two attendants at check-in desks and both were unhelpful and rude. I asked one guy if there was room on an earlier flight and to avoid checking he told me it would cost $100 to change flights (not what I asked). Then I was trying to help a lady who missed her connection, as the plane was still at the gate, and the attendant basically just said “too bad” and didn’t offer to help her get on a different flight or anything even though it was AA’s fault she missed her connection.

She said don't worry we will be first off plane. Well she lied and when I asked her as we were getting off flight she shrugged shoulders and did bit answer. We ran to connecting flight to have the door shut in our face and told we would have to get another flight. We did and 24 hours later finally arrive at Gainesville to having my luggage lost.

There was a woman working who was very unhelpful and rude and the other staff was just standing around when the kiosk wasn't working to get our tickets. On my sister's return flight, they charged $50 for her bag and there was ample room for it under the seat. She doesn't even carrying a purse so this was literally all she had.

The seats themselves are significantly narrower and flimsy. To say the seats are uncomfortable is an understatement. And this was a transatlantic flight. The food was barely edible, came with terrible plastic utensils and was basically thrown at us. Service was totally disinterested.

My daughter was in a foreign country without her luggage for 9 days. I called AA 3 times and they could not care less. They do not care about their customers and will do nothing to help you if you have an issue. Worst customer service ever!";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-06-13;" | They don’t really care about customer relations. I have seen several times that they overbook the flights when seriously, with advent of technology, it can clearly be avoided. They don’t even have enough staff at airports to run things smoothly. Let me tell you what I went through: 1) First my flight from Cedar Rapids to Chicago was delayed by 3 hours. You know how far Chicago is from Cedar Rapids? Just 30 minutes if we go by air. This has happened to me twice. You know airlines from other countries are carrying passengers on their transatlantic flights without delays, cancellations and excellent customer service. Its about time they visit those countries and take a lesson on how to provide a valuable customer service. 2) Then, they let everyone board the plane but somehow manage to find an excuse to not take off. We had to wait for take-off on tarmac for 2 hours and on top of that, the pilot doesn’t even announce periodically what is going on. This was agonizing for so many passengers. I purposely selected this flight because I had a 3 hour layover in Chicago and I was going to meet my friend, but because of delays caused by American Airlines, I will have to wait for another couple of months. Don’t even tell me it was a weather related delay as it was sunny! They clearly either didn’t have pilots or planes to provide the service and yet, booked us knowing very well that their services were not adequate in any way. I reached Chicago Airport at 5.30 pm when I was supposed to arrive there around 2.30 pm. But this was just the beginning. 3) Then while waiting for my next plane out of Chicago to Newark, they very cleverly increased the delay by 15-20 minutes at one time so that customers don’t cancel with them and fly with any other airlines because when you incrementally delay flights by 15 minutes, customers are more likely to stay with that particular airline in order to reach their destination. Whereas, if you had displayed from the beginning that it was 2-3 hours delay, customers were more likely to look for other options to reach their destination. 4) Then we boarded the plane at 8.30 pm, 2.5 hours after scheduled time and the same thing happened. We were on the runway for the next 2.5 hours. 2.5 hours! For what? No one knows. Crew failed to provide any update. There was no weather delays again. After 2.5 hours, the pilot turned the plane back to gate telling that he has completed his hours and couldn’t fly. Tell me about commitment levels displayed by American Airlines. Clearly, there is nothing American about your airlines anymore. 5) Then, I was told bags will arrive at carousel 6 and they arrived at carousel 7 instead. Ground staff in baggage claim area didn’t even have a clue that my flight was cancelled. When I asked about where was my bag, I gave him my bag ticket and he was said “what was texture of your bag, what color was your bag”? What sort of ridiculous questions were they? 7) Now, I had to skip my whole day at work. Horrible!";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2018-06-11;" |  Jacksonville to New York via Charlotte. Sleeping at CLT: How a flight crew laid waste our $4105.29 AA Vacation family weekend in New York. First, when I wrote my review of our AA Vacations Westin La Paloma trip in April, I didn't think that experience could be worsted (opposite of bested), so I didn't expect to be writing about another superlatively bad AA Vacation again, at least not so soon. I was wrong. The moral of this story is if you value the welfare of your family, your time and your money, don't rely on AA Vacations. But I've gotten ahead of myself. Here's our story. Things went beautifully on the first leg of what was to have been a fun family weekend in NY to celebrate the end of our son's school year. We sped through TSA pre, were greeted courteously at the gate and took our assigned seats in first class on AA1937. After a pleasant short flight to Charlotte, we connected to AA1981 bound for LaGuardia. When that flight didn't push away on time, the captain announced from the flight deck that a ""minor technical issue"" would hold us up briefly. I followed a running text stream of delay notices from AA on my phone. Then I received the dreaded notice of cancellation. Oddly, the flight crew were still telling us that the “technical issue” was in the process of being fixed. Specifically, the pilot advised that the copilot had flown too many hours to legally make the trip to NY and AA was on the hunt for a replacement. When I told the cabin attendant that the flight had been cancelled, she passed the news to the captain who, nonplussed, announced that ""apparently American Airlines notifies passengers of cancellations before telling its crew."" We were advised to deplane and come back at 7:00 a.m. the following day. I immediately called AA Vacations who had booked as part of our package non-refundable tickets for activities and events on Saturday. I got a terrific agent named Kristen who nimbly booked us on a flight to Newark. She even kept our first-class status! All we had to do was run the mile from the end of terminal C to the end of terminal B before the flight's scheduled 10:00 departure. We needn't have run. The flight to Newark was delayed due to a mechanical. First 11:00, then 12:00, then vouchers to Starbucks, then 1:00, then first class boarded, then we were told to deplane, then 2:00. and then it was cancelled. The gate agent, a terrific woman with a superman pin affixed to her purse, explained sincerely sympathetically that because NASCAR was in town there were no hotel rooms left in Charlotte. Like Tom Hanks in The Terminal we were to live in the airport for the night. No options. We dragged ourselves back to gate C19, the assigned departure gate for AA9200, boarding at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. We were heartened to see an airplane already parked there. With nothing to eat, no place to sleep and no cardboard boxes, we were all newly sympathetic to street people. We put as cheerful a face on the five hour night as we could. When boarding time came, we didn't board. The plane that had been sitting at gate C19, on which we had hung the night's hopes was ""the wrong size."" Yes, the gate agent said he had been given an airplane ""the wrong size"" for the number of passengers booked. I could feel the crowd of passengers working itself into a mob. Since most like us had been bumped from the CLT/LGA and CLT/EWR flights the night before, I could well sympathize.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-06-11;" | I purchased tickets Mar. 17 which had us flying out of PDX and arriving in Cozumel the same day. In Sept. 17, I received an email that AA changed our reservations. It seemed fine since it was a shorter travel time than the original tickets. The a.m. of the flight we arrived to check in at PDX, and during the self-check in, we got a priority slip. We took it to the ticket counter and learned that when AA changed our flights, they did not allow their own “mandatory” 50 minutes for the connection flight. As such, they refused to allow us to catch our connection from DFW to CZM. Keep in mind that this was their mandatory layover time and they made the change that didn’t conform to it! AA was unable to locate a flight that would get us into Cozumel the same day, so we were forced to incur an overnight layover at DFW. To add insult to injury, each leg of each flight they were challenged to allow me and my fiancé sit together. We would have to pay at the ticket gate to move seats. Um, we purchased our tickets at the same time, is it too far of a stretch to consider we might want to sit together! So, for four flights we had to take extra time to “sweet talk” the gate agent into letting us sit together. Unbelievable! Due to the layover resulting from AA’s error, we were forced to incur additional hotel and meal costs, spend time rearranging transfers, contacting the hotel, etc., lost an entire day of vacation time/pay, lost our all-inclusive charges and hotel charge from the hotel in Cozumel, stressed out having to pick up the pieces because of AA’s mistake, and now I’m getting the pleasure of fighting with AA since they are only offering is a $250 flight voucher for each of us. That doesn’t come close to compensating for the time, money, and trouble they caused. And actually, at this point, I wish I were fighting with them. They’ve gone incommunicado. Won’t call when they say they will, won’t return calls. and, who would want vouchers from this joke of an airline? The only silver lining was the accommodating flight attendants. Otherwise, this company ought to be ashamed of themselves. Based on my research, this isn’t a one off.";NEGATIVE

She looked us up and proceeded to become incredibly rude and told us that we had to empty our carry ons and try to cram everything into our backpacks and throw away our brand new carry-on luggage, or pay $210 to check them. After making the announcement that they would check them complementary. She was not helpful, made my daughter cry because we had to choose if what personal items to keep or throw away.

The FA kept hitting my shoulder all night long as she was walking back and forth down the aisle. I asked if they had a self service cart with juice/water and snacks in the back galley like most civilized airlines do and the told me it was not the case on this flight.

After going to the new location and seating there for about 45 minutes. We were told that our gate had changed back to the gate we were originally at. Finally we get to board the plane around 8:45. The pilot comes over the intercom and says ""please take your seats we only have 6 minutes before our crew times out. At this time the fuel truck had just pulled up. After about 10 minutes. The pilot comes back on the intercom and tells us that the crew has times out and that they were not going to be able to fly us to Denver. So the pilots exit the plane. 10 minutes later the flight attendant come on and say ""we have a new fight crew on the way and we will be leaving as soon as they get here"". 45 minutes to an hour later after sitting on the plane she comes back on only to tell us that there was no new crew and we needed to get off the plane. Now it's around 11:00-11:30. After about an hour of sitting at the gate waiting to hear of any updates. They tell us there's a new fight crew is coming and we would be leaving as soon as they arrived and do there pre-flight checks. So around 12:15 or so the new crew starts to arrive. First 1 pilot, 20 minutes later another pilot, 20 later the engineer comes. I guess. They tell us we will be taking off shortly. Around 1:15 a.m or so. They tell us the the flight attendants have now timed out and our flight would be canceled. It's funny now but not really. They then tell us that we have to go back to the other gate to rebook our flights out. Luckily for us we knew the number to call for rebooking. So we were able to get on the next flight out at 6:45 Tuesday morning. My wife tells me today that they gave her a $100 voucher. Not only did they know they were going to have to cancel the flight but they were dishonest and didn't have to decency to tell us the truth. I have not received anything for them nor do I care to.

Normally I don’t have problems with AA but after a recent flight cancellation for the second part of my journey, I am very disappointed with the lack of action on AA’s part. My flight which was on a Sunday night was delayed for about 1.5-2 hours at which point it was canceled due to “maintenance issues.” I called AA to reschedule a flight and also went to the customer service desk. I had a flight for work the following morning at 10:30 so I really need to get back. I asked if I could be put on another flight, switched airlines, flown out somewhere else and come from another place, get a rental car, or anything that would allow me to make my flight the next morning. They said there is nothing I can do but I can go online and get a reimbursement which should be up to $120. I ended up having to rent a car and drive from DFW to OKC which cost me about $260. I have tried to be reimbursed for this cost but the best I got was a $100 voucher that has to be used within a year. The problem is very few flights cost $100 so this forces me to fly AA again within the year and have to pay them more out of my pocket so this is in no way a reimbursement but a way for them to secure my future business. Additionally the refund for my flight was $79. I feel like I did everything I could possibly do on my part to remedy the situation and felt very helpless. I am very disappointed with AA’s effort on this and I will likely turn to other airlines in the future. The next flight I could have flown on was at 4:50 the following night and AA never offered to put me in a hotel so I would have just had to stay in the airport or pay for a hotel anyways. AA created a situation where I was at their mercy for assistance and did nothing.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-06-07;" |  My entire American Airlines experience was a complete nightmare. I was traveling from Myrtle Beach to Detroit with my wife and 8-month old daughter. Our original flight plan involved a 1-hour layover in DC. After boarding in Myrtle Beach we were instructed there was a weather delay and we were taken off the plane. After waiting 45+ minutes in line at the gate, and being refused help from the neighboring American Airlines gate, we were rebooked for a 1-hour layover in Charlotte. When that flight was also delayed I expressed concern at the gate because we may not make the connector in Charlotte. The employee was disinterested in helping us find a backup plan in case this occurred. When we arrived in Charlotte we had no chance of making the connector. The employee in Myrtle Beach knew full well that we would not make this connector but sent us onto the plane anyway. After waiting 90+ minutes to speak to customer service in Charlotte we were rebooked to travel to Chicago, then to Toledo. We ran through the airport in order to make the flight to Chicago, but later found out that our checked luggage was left in Charlotte. 4 planes in 4 separate airports before we arrived home (with our 8-month old daughter!) at 12:30a. When I filed a formal complaint with the airline we received a token apology.";NEGATIVE

Once everyone was on the plane the pilot announced that we were gonna load on more people who’s flight had been cancelled earlier in the day and that this would make us at least an hour late. Once in air the food was horrendous and inedible and that’s coming from someone who never complains about food. Apart from that the bathroom was extremely untidy with sticky toilet seats. When we landed we were once again waiting and were stuck on the runway for approximately 50 minutes. This all resulted in us being over 2 hours late. If you have another option then choose that one because American is a disgrace. I usually fly with Lufthansa and this was really a downgrade.;NEGATIVE

I have never flown before and neither have my children. I have a daughter with special needs and disabilities so I made sure to make all the necessary phone calls to airports, TSA, and American Airlines. I wanted to make sure everything would go smoothly for her and that we wouldn't have any problems with her special needs during flights and her special needs stroller. Even though I made all the calls and had pre-boarding, I wasn't expecting the attention we got. Before each flight, I went to remind the American Airlines Customer service rep of our situation but to my surprise, they were already aware. They even said, ""yes, we are all ready for lauren."" They knew her name! I was just amazed. No problems with her stroller getting gate checked and when our flight ended, her stroller was in the terminal waiting for us. Even the flight attendance knew her name and gave her special attention. She even got a chance to see the cockpit. I am so incredibly thankful for the great experience that American Airlines gave us for our first ever flight. You made things so much easier and we were all able to enjoy our first plane ride. Thank you so much again and I hope our return home on Saturday is just as great. I will always fly American Airlines!";POSITIVE

Once we were at our final gate we continued to wait for our delays to pass and boarded the plane. Once boarded there was an announcement about the flight crew being timed out so they couldn’t fly us and we would have to deplane. We deplaned and waited 2 hours in the gate to get new pilots.

I have been delayed on ALL of my flights on this trip by no less than 45 minutes. Twice out of all of these, the original projected delay wasn’t even long enough and as I type this I have waited an additional 15 minutes past the delay. I have experienced one outstanding flight attendant on these flights, the rest we sub-par. AA has little to no entertainment, rabbit food for snacks (not literally), and worst of all, because it saves the airlines a little money, they book absurd amounts of standby passengers (22 on this flight). AA, get back to treating your customers the way customers should be treated instead of trying to fill your pockets. If I had a choice, I’d never fly this airline again.";NEGATIVE

For some reason, even if for some flights I was located at the back of the aircraft, I was placed in all flights to board on group 8 (the group after the very low priority group, even though I had a 3-leg flight). This was a problem on the way back from Dallas to Los Angeles, when they run out of overhead compartments and tried to make me check my carry on all the way to Sydney (they did not offer valet bag checking). I tried explaining that I had a 6 hours layover in LA and then a very long flight to Sydney, and that I needed my carry on (get very cold on places, and was going to arrive to winter in Sydney), and that I did not understand how the system, knowing that I had a long flight ahead would place me in the last boarding group. After a very unpleasant moment with very unfriendly personnel at the Dallas airport, I was able to bring my carry on in some extra spaces available. Additionally, even I had purchased the ticket earlier, the system would not let me pick seats in one of the flights, so I had to travel in the mid seat, next to the bathroom. They should really try to improve customer service, and respect people paying full ticket fare in advance. For now I will try to avoid American Airlines as much as possible in the future.";NEGATIVE

An absolute disaster of an airport. It’s old, dirty, and the people are rude. The American Airlines gates were all full of people who were angry because of delays, etc. Our flight too was late getting out, we sat on for an hour waiting to take off, serious traffic jam. No bad weather, just way too many flights. Return flight: Daytona to Seattle delayed because of a computer routine maintenance not performed? (per the Captain). A billion dollar company who forgets this? This flight delayed a few hours which caused us to miss connection in Charlotte. New flight meant a 9 hour delay in the awful Charlotte airport. Once we board new flight, we sat for 3 hours because of thunderstorms. American Airlines boarded us knowing this storm was here. A storm doesn’t just show up without warning. So 3 hours on tarmac and then 6 hours for flight. A total of 9 hours we were on this plane. The head flight attendant was a jerk (older male). Didn’t smile not one single time and was very rude to some older folks who got up to use bathroom when seatbelt sign came on because of turbulence. Flight attendants were only at row 10 when they ran out of food you can purchase. And to be offered something to drink only once to folks who have been on a plane 9 hours is just pathetic.

Boy was that about the biggest mistake ever. So the actual flying experience wasn’t bad at all. The problem came when my arriving flight into Charlotte, NC to catch a connection was delayed to the gate due to weather. Which was fine, we can’t control the weather. The delay also delayed my connecting flight to Fort Walton Beach. So I was still able to catch my connection. That’s fantastic.  Absolutely it was. So I ask the boarding agent if there was a chance that my checked bag wouldn’t get transferred in time to the connecting flight. She said that it’s very possible that it won’t make it in time. So I said that’s ok I’ll work around picking up my bag the next day. And the next day (today) is where the problem started. I show up at 6am and there’s no one at the baggage claim office, no customer service representative to be found. I talked to the ladies at the ticket counter twice and they told me someone be down to help. So I’m there 3 hours before someone opens the door and it takes 2 minutes to get my bag. Why did it take 3 hours? The monitors show when they have flights departing and arriving. There was plenty of time between to accommodate the 2 minutes it took me to get my bag.

We then missed our connecting flight from Charlotte to New Orleans and the next one was almost 4 hours later. We had paid extra to have seats next to each other and in preferred seating and when we got off the plane and had to get new boarding passes we were basically told too bad nothing they can do about it. When we arrived to New Orleans everything in my bag was damp and all my clothes had to be put in the dryer. But i had nothing in my bag that could've leaked. On the way back, we had a layover in Chicago of an hour until our connecting flight to Newark. 40 minutes before our flight we found out we're delayed an hour and a half.

My flight was supposed to leave at 1030am from LaGuardia, which turned into 1130am then to 12.50pm mind you I had been sitting st the airport since 8.30am. The only flights left to my final destination was a 10.30pm flight out of DFW meaning I would sit in DFW for 6-7 hours or more depending on delays. Turning a 6 hour travel day into a 17 hour flight day. Additionally I would have missed that flight if I would have not gotten up to go to the restroom and so happen to look at the monitor to see that the gate had changed. No communication what so ever about the gate change. We did not depart to almost 1:15pm - mind you they gave us 0 information about the whereabouts or why our flight was delayed for nearly 2 hours. Finally we made it to Dallas 3.5 hours later. At this point I was tired and irritable. Thank you to the kind woman at DFW working for AA, who got me on a flight sooner than 1030pm, she was patient, kind and emphatic. She made sure I still had my first class seat and all.

My frustration lies with a delay on the ground. It was only announced that the flight would be delayed once we landed because we didn't have a gate, and customs was backed up. We sat waiting for over an hour, returning from an international flight, we still had customs, and another round of security to go through before reaching our connecting flight. We ended up missing our connection, we were rerouted back to the entrance without being told where we were going, when we still had 15min to catch our plane, had they called and had it wait for us, we could have caught it. Instead we were forced to rebook another flight. Communication wasn't great at this point. We thought we were getting rebooked for another route that would get us home only an hour after our original flight, and one flight, as we had originally booked. But we were handed two tickets (rather than the one) on a flight that didn't depart till the next day. They claimed that they don't comp hotels if it's due to weather, the reason for the delay, but no one ever said that we were delayed due to weather. She said I couldn't talk to a manager and wouldn't make eye contact with me after I complained. I would now arrive home a day later, and have to pay $150 more than I originally planned to pay for a cab and hotel. The lady who helped us the next morning was really friendly and didn't charge us to check our bags even though we didn't have receipts for the original payment. She also adjusted our seats so we could sit together. Overall service on the plane was good. Maybe when booking connecting international flights the airlines should require a minimum time in between to eliminate the stress of connecting flights in between.

I was the typical customer making a connection that was predetermined by the airline. Using decades of history and algorithms to maximize efficiency for the company and yet getting customer where they need to be you would think this would not be an issue anymore. We got off one plane and literally ran across the airport getting to our terminal 10 minutes before it was scheduled to leave at which they told us ""we knew you were checked in and coming but we can't let you in 10 minutes before flight"". At that time we gave them a confused look as it was 10 minutes before the flight. So you see where I am going with this and why I will never fly with them again but the story gets better from there. We go down to customer service as instructed by the gate attendant to see if we can get on the next flight that is 3 hours delay which sounds good at first but not when you have family waiting for you that drove over 4 hours to pick you up. We had asked if they could do anything from free tickets to a cup of coffee of which they denied saying this happens all the time and it is not our fault. And now for the icing on the cake, they were not sure where our luggage was and after 5 minutes they said it made it on to our original flight. Crazy how that works out right? Now after if spins around the turn style for 45 minutes and hopefully nobody takes it they said it will be picked up and then placed in an office for us to pick up. Long story short, we fly often enough that I am 100% confident saying that American Airlines has some major room to improve so please use another even if you pay a few $ more.";NEGATIVE

The in-flight entertainment on the contrary was a surprise - it worked well and the movie selection was quite wide. What I really don't understand is the seating allocation policy of the airline - we used it twice, always used the recommended kiosk self-check in option and in both cases we got a boarding pass with no assigned seats along with a note ""please see agent at the gate"", which we did and we got the boarding pass from him.

I understand that these things happen. But when arriving in Dallas to switch connections to go to Shreveport, I rushed to my gate and found that my plane was still at the gate. But they would not allow me to board. The flight departed earlier than scheduled with me watching it leave the gate without me. I was very disappointed that American did not notify the gate that a passenger was a few minutes late due to their late arrival of a connecting flight. It is not like it was an hour or more, it was 10 minutes at most. Other airlines that I have flown have notified other gates of this happening, especially if it is weather related. I am a frequent flier on many airlines, and it has been done for me before. Due to this, I was under a lot of stress. My main reason for going to Shreveport was to meet my daughter and get her back home to Florida. I went to flight services in Dallas, and they were not any help at all. No monetary help or voucher for a hotel overnight either. They attempted to help me with getting my checked bag that arrived with me in Dallas, but the employee from my arriving gate had already gone home because it was after 9. Because of this, my bag left the next morning to go to Shreveport, even though I was going to be leaving from Dallas later in the day to go back to Florida with my daughter, who was arriving from Shreveport. To make things worse, I had to wait 6 days to get my suitcase returned to me in Florida. After checking with American baggage services, I found out that it stayed in Shreveport for 5 days sitting there. My bag had important business materials inside. Needless to say, unless it is a last resort, I will not be flying American Airlines again.

They also refused to reimburse for meals and are refusing to escalate the matter as their Executives do not take part of these matters. Way to treat your customers American Airlines! Should have read all the negative reviews before I paid $600 for this flight that left me stranded for an extra 2 days in Philadelphia.";NEGATIVE

The lady at the gate was very rude to me and my family, we were in Group 9,the lady kept on telling us that don’t you know what Group 9 means and acted not at all polite with me and my family. I understand that there are rules but there is better way of talking to customers and informing them the rules. This was my first time with American Airlines and my start of the trip was very disappointing. A staff cannot be so rude to my family just because we had more than one bag, and the extra bag was a purse and not a bag.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-05-27;" |  Puerto Vallarta to Tucson. We flew to Puerto Vallarta for our 15th anniversary. The flight there was great. We were saddened to return home from such a beautiful place filled with very nice people. We arrived at the airport early, at 10:00am. When we were trying to process our boarding passes, the woman working at the counter was extremely rude for some reason. Her and her colleague were rolling their eyes and seemed to be annoyed that I was speaking English with my American wife. They made derogatory comments towards my wife being American. She became irate when I was explaining to her that I was a Permanent U.S Resident. I speak fluent Spanish and she ignored me and said she had to call immigration in Phoenix? She left and returned to process my wife's pass. I asked her if I could explain to whomever she was trying to contact my status. I told her that I obviously boarded a plane to get here, and that I needed to get home. I was polite the entire time and she was rude to my wife for no reason. She then said. I can't let you board. No explanation what so ever. My heart sank. I maintain composure and asked her to let me talk to her imaginary friend who she supposedly called at Customs. She just smiled and said Sorry. I asked her to have my Wife board and then I would need a flight rearranged to my native Sonora so I could contact someone at the Consulate. She faked smiled again and said sorry, we can't do anything. She then said I would have to purchase another ticket. I promptly bought a ticket on AeroMexico and had no issues getting to Hermosillo, except for the fact that my Wife flew alone, She had to explain to my two kids that I was in Mexico because some AA rep at the desk was discriminating me because I am Mexican and live in the US, Not to mention I had to fly to Mexico City, get delayed to thunderstorms there 2 hours, finally flew to Sonora at Midnight. I arrived in Hermosillo at 2 in the morning. Somehow I got to the Nogales border, thanks to a friend. Crossed the U.S Border at 7am with no issues. I had to be at work. I was exhausted and very frustrated. Honestly a terrible way to end our 15 year anniversary. Never flying AA ever again.";NEGATIVE

However, our experience was the opposite of most of the recent reviews. The Flagship Lounge at JFK, while very busy, provided a good opportunity for a pre-flight meal. The flight, AA 100, to LHR left a few minutes behind schedule, but landed on time. The flight attendants offered reasonably friendly in-flight service throughout. There was more food and drink on offer during the flight than anyone could have wanted (dinner, snacks, more snacks, breakfast). The lie flat seat, with Casper bedding, while a tad firm for some most likely, provided the opportunity to get a short nights sleep. Fortunately, we never experienced even one of the horrors that so many reviewers have written about. We will fly back to JFK on Monday, in the Premium Economy cabin, and if the experience is any different, based of course on what is reasonably expected in that cabin, we will add a review.";POSITIVE

american-airlines;2018-05-23;" | First I'd like to start out saying that 20 years ago, I had the exact same result as I did this past weekend and swore I would never fly American Airlines again. I was returning to Houston from Salt Lake City, I had to go thru Dallas for a connecting flight. My flight in Salt Lake City was delayed due to weather issues originally. I knew I was going to miss my connecting flight in Dallas, once I heard of the delay and got up in line (a long one at that) to be told to call the 1-800 number to get done faster. When I spoke with customer service, they told me ""I'll be fine as the plane is supposed to board at 4.08 pm"" and I was like ""Oh great, ok, I don't need anything else then"". Not realizing the time when I hung up the phone, it was 4.12 pm and there was no plane at the gate. So, we (as in other passengers and myself) were getting updates saying we were boarding every 10 minutes. Come to find out, because of the weather, the plane that was trying to land was re-routed to Pocatello, ID because they needed to re-fuel. The plane finally landed around 6.15 pm, only to learn that our flight was now cancelled due to the fact that the flight crew had met their hours for the day and couldn't fly anymore. So, at that point we were all stranded, most other flights were full and I for sure was going to miss my connecting flight. Supposedly, because this was a weather issue, American Airlines would not put any of the passengers up in hotels, etc. However, it was no longer a weather issue as other planes were flying in and taking off just fine in Salt Lake City. This was clearly, American Airlines crew that couldn't fly anymore. So our flight was delayed until 7.00 am the next morning. So we return to the airport, did not receive any updates on our flight and hoping for the best I spoke with the gentleman at the gate and asked him to help me find a connecting flight to Houston. He told me, they were all full and to try once I get to Dallas to get on stand by. I finally make it to Dallas, I get off the plane and go directly to the ticket counter at the gate that I just walked out of. I explained that I needed a connecting flight to Houston. At first, the lady couldn't find me in the system (even though I just walked off the plane) and then once she did find me in the system, she said she had record of me landing the night before in Dallas. At this point, I was boiling mad, because clearly she just saw me walk off the plane. Then she said, there was a flight later in the evening that she could get me on. I explained it was my daughter's graduation party that evening and I needed to be home before 8.00 pm that night. So, she handed me a boarding pass and told me to go try and get on Stand by on another flight. Went to that gate only to find out there was a lot of other people standing by and probably would not make that flight and at that point I went and got a rental car so I can be home in time for my daughter's graduation party, that I was hosting. My biggest disappoint in the airline is that not one American Airlines employee even said ""I'm sorry!"" When you work in customer service and have an upset customer, you should always acknowledge that you understand the frustration and you are working hard to get us home or to resolve the issue. This never happened with American Airlines. I was met with one rude person after the other. It wasn't just me. There were other passengers that were just as upset and had to drive home too.";NEGATIVE

Why didn't they announce it for all of section 9 until right before the flight was boarding, when I would have had time to go back to the baggage claim and only have to pay 25 dollars instead of 50 now for a carry on size. No military discount for luggage either which is ridiculous. I will never fly American Airlines again with how rude they were.";NEGATIVE

I Arrived at 5am to DCA To a weather delay (understandable) Couple hours passed and when we went to board the plane a new maintenance issue caused a 20 minute delay. For the next 5 hours they kept extending the maintenance delay every 30 minutes. There was almost no communication with each attendant telling different answers. The app was also extremely unhelpful. After waiting in airport for 12 hours, they finally cancelled the flight as never going to leave the terminal. I called customer service for a refund and they said that they might be able to reschedule. Another attendant the said that I should still cancel and get refund since the airline was backed up and going to be prone to more weather delays and maintenance issues. (Every person had different answers) I asked if I could just get a voucher to help make up for lost hotel, stress, etc. Two reps said yes but another said that they couldn’t. Long story short they cancelled my flight then left me out to dry with just the refund of my ticket and no additional vouchers. I am still out a large sum for the trip not including lost vacation days and stress. This was the worst customer experience of my life. I was a loyalty program member with an AA credit card and was Still treated this way by staff and the company even after filing a complaint. “...They told me (paraphrase) that it was not their obligation and that I should give them a second chance...” I was lied to and lost an entire vacation to their terrible maintenance and business practices and would urge no person to use AA as their preferred loyalty program.

Once onboard is their in flight snacks, they start at 9 and increase significantly. On this particular trip they switched the gate and terminal 4 times within the span of 2 hours before the flight which made for some long walks. Surprisingly our flight arrived 30 min early but we had to wait the entire 30 minutes on the plane at the gate before we could deboard because they couldn’t find an employee to move the sky bridge into place!

The American gate next to it, had 5 employees, talking, laughing, not doing anything. I went over to them and asked if they could help me. I had been in my line for 30 minutes and the employee had only gotten through 2 people! So you can imagine the anger of everyone in line! The 5 employees at the adjacent gate said they couldn't help and really didn't seem to care enough to walk over to our gate to help that 1 lone employee. I found that to be so incompetent for this or any airlines. Worst part for me was, my daughter was gong to the same wedding, also flew out from the same airport, same time, with JetBlue.

We had 4 flights with them and all were bang on time. I like the fact that AA flies in Frankfurt from the much quieter terminal 2. We were recevied by very friendly groundstaff and had our bag dropped within 15 mins. AA holds firmly to the boarding-by-group system which I like very much. The flight from Frankfurt to Charlotte was good: a rather tasty meal and plenty of drinks and snacks. We only had 1,5 hour connection time to Nashville, so we were a bit weary about that, because you have tot go through immigration and collect your bag again and go through security again, but is was okay. Airport staff is ready tot take your bag immediately from you after immigration so you can rush through security. By the time we got tot the gate boarding began and again we had a very punctual departure for Nashville. Small snack and a drink on this one-hour flight was enough. Checking in in Nashville for our inbound flight again was a breeze. Again very friendly ground staff (we've experienced different before!) and within 10 mins we were at the gate. Flight from Nashville to Philadelphia took only 1,5 hours in stead of the advertised 2 hours and 10 mins and that was good since we had only 50 mins connecting time in Philadelphia. Still quite a run because we arrived at B10 and our plane to Frankfurt was at the furthest gate (A26). By the time we arrived we were almost the last ones to board. Our son wasn't assigned a seat in Nashville but his boarding pass with seat was ready in Philadelphia. Four the fourth time a very punctual departure. Again a meal, rather bland but okay and plenty of drinks and snacks. Breakfast -well, sort of- an hour for landing. 280 films and games to choose from.

They obviously didn't want to be dealing with the customers and were, at times, even sarcastic to their passengers. My touch screen didn't work but I didn't dare ask the attendants for assistance and get a snarky answer. The food was marginal, at best, but it was the attitude of the crew that spoiled the travel. The gate crew on Charlotte even mocked the passengers from the preceding flight within hearing of the waiting passengers. No wonder my flights were not full.

This was a serious problem, because the pilots were set to time out 1 hour and 18 minutes after the original departure time. A series of blunders followed, including a broken fuel pump, which slowed refueling. We ultimately left with under a minute remaining before the pilots would have timed out. I don't like an airline flying by the seat of their pants. The only positive were the flight crew, who may have been the most pleasant crew I have encountered with an airline. However, they weren't able to cover for American's failings here.";NEGATIVE

From Philly to the Big Island there were no TV’s on either flight. One little screen in the aisle that dropped down and played one stupid movie. Two passes of the beverage cart with a handful of pretzels. American Airlines need to put planes into service that have individual TV’s for flights that are longer than 3 hours. Our red eye home from LA also had no TV’s. Thanks American Airlines from all the people who cannot sleep on a night time flight! I couldn’t even get a pillow and a blanket on my red eye! Last year I flew coach on Lufthansa to Germany and was in row 38. I felt like I was in first class! Free booze the duration of the flight, full dinner served with real plates and silverware that was complimentary, and pillows and blankets, and wait for it! TV’s for every single passenger! American Airlines needs to see how to keep their passengers happy buy making their flight more comfortable and not dumping all their money into Philadelphia Terminal B. Every single seat at every bar, lounge, waiting are had a tablet and a charging station next to it. The place looked like a night club! So much for keeping your passengers on your flights comfortable!";NEGATIVE

They wouldn't even let us correct the error without paying 200 dollars. This is easily the worst service that I've received from an airline.

Expect a hard fight to receive any form of compensation for the inconveniences that they inflict on you. Expect to talk to numerous agents on the phone and at the airport, wasting hours of your time, until you eventually (if you have the patience to see it through) find that one person who will take five seconds of their time to help you. Expect some staff members to simply ignore you when you ask them questions. Expect that you will not make it to your destination at the time printed on your ticket. Even if you do make it onto a plane eventually (likely not the one you originally booked) expect it to be very cramped and uncomfortable. I have flown American Airlines numerous times over the past few years. Every time is a struggle. At  Boston Logan Airport and Philadelphia Airport especially, the staff simply refuse to help when something goes wrong. They will instead resort to silence or walk away when you try to ask a question. At American Airlines, your problems are not their concern. Getting you to your destination on time is not their concern. Your comfort is not their concern.

I understand why the flight needed to be cancelled, however we were told by American Airlines staff that our luggage had been sent too Toronto on another flight. Which made absolutely no sense to me. We did not have a return flight until Wednesday which meant we had 3 days without any clothing/personal products. I requested some sort of financial compensation because of this and was told that baggage does not handle compensation and to go upstairs and put in a request. When we were upstairs we were told to get into 3 different line ups once we were finally able to speak to someone we were told that they did not provide compensation (I understand about the flight cancellation but believed they should not have sent our suitcases ahead without us). I asked to speak to the supervisor and she told me that they have nothing to do with baggage and if I wanted financial compensation I needed to go back to baggage. She then checked our baggage tags and said our luggage was still in the airport. We then went back downstairs and spoke to someone who was in the luggage area, he was extremely rude so I asked to speak to his supervisor and he refused to call one. His coworker could tell I was becoming visibly upset so called a supervisor. She then left. We waited for approximately 10 minutes and ask the employee who had refused to call a supervisor if they were coming and he said ""no, if you want to speak to a supervisor you need to stand in that line over there"". So we went and stood in line again . Once through the line I asked to speak to the supervisor and told her that we were told upstairs that our suitcases were still in the airport. She said they maybe here but we could not have them and they were going to be forwarded to Toronto. I then asked for financial compensation for toiletries, clothing etc and she told me I had to go back upstairs to Customer Assistance that they do not handle compensation. I then lost my temper because this was the third time I was told to go to a different spot. Every single staff I dealt with at American Airlines that day was extremely rude and continuously told us we were in the wrong line up, department or it wasn't something they handled. We did eventually get our luggage back the next day but I believe it was largely do to the fact that I was persistent and lost my temper. I would like to mention that there was one staff member in customer assistance who was pleasant to deal with when my mother and I went to confirm our seat on Tuesday April 17th - he needs need to find another airline to work for, and is far too nice of a person to be working with such rude, awful, unhelpful people.";NEGATIVE

I have always flown southwest, and never felt like I was being nickle and dimed by them. I will never fly American again. I think this ended up costing at least $100 more than Southwest, and they make sure you don't get to sit with your traveling partner.

The flight was scheduled to start boarding at 11:45 at C29. I checked the board around 11 to confirm and still had this gate. Around 12 after the flight had not been called I wondered if I was at the right gate. I pulled up flight on my phone which said flight had been changed to C28 which was in hearing range of where I was sitting. The flight was never announced and I had missed it. When I went to counter, the agent proceeded to tell me that it was my responsibility to find out which gate and they did not have to announce it. I informed the agent I had checked the board within the hour and the gate was listed as C29. He stated everyone was already there and so he didn’t have to announce. However me and my 4 kids were less than 15 yards away and we were not on board. Even the “customer care” department who I spoke with on the phone had this not my problem attitude. If I had not been so close to the terminal from which my flight departed I would not have a problem.

Fast forward to our last flight from Toronto to Regina, and they didn’t even put us on our last flight, and didn’t confirm the rescheduled flight, so we were stranded, yet again. We barely managed to get someone to get us a hotel and food vouchers for the night, after another hour of searching through the airport. After we got home, we emailed customer support to only get compensated a couple hundred Americans airline dollars for our trouble.

We got in the sky and about 2 hours into our travel. There was an announcement from the captain explaining that we have to fasten our seatbelts immediately because we would have to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers because they were low on fuel. Im not quite sure why the airplane would be low on fuel about 2 hours into the short trip! That is absolutely absurd! Shortly after that there was another announcement from one of the flight attendants stating that she knows we all have questions and she does not have the answers to in a very frantic voice putting us all In a very scared state. Im not quite sure what she meant by that because the answer was to get more fuel which seemed like an absolute lie or cover up of some sort. Once we finally landed in Fort Myers me and the 4 other people that I was with the 3 that were on the reservation with me, and a friend from another reservation demanded to get off of the plane because we felt  unsafe along with some other people that wanted off of the plane. We were told that we were not allowed off of the plane. Not only were we afraid for our lives because of the low fuel incident, we felt as though we were being held hostage. The captain and other workers were extremely rude to us and made us feel very uneasy! They even told us we are on our own when we got off of the plane after ripping up our tickets. After telling us that we were not allowed off of the plane and to take our seats we all demanded to get off. Finally, they let us off of the plane snatched our tickets and ripped them up. We had to pay for a rental car to get to the final destination Miami and drive for about 3 hours due to thunderstorms. We did not reach our destination until after 10:30pm. This has been a disaster! This was my first flight and not sure that I will be getting on another plane again. Our 2-3 hr flight turned into a 16.5 hour trip, more money spent on a rental, afraid for our lives, and an entire day lost! Our way home was on a Frontier airline and took us 2 hours and 5 minutes.!

After waiting 5 minutes, I just finished without assistance. He then came over to me and said “I’m here now”. I told him “that’s ok”. He proceeded to stand next to me while I waited for my boarding pass. I was clearly aggravated, but I didn’t say anything more to him. As I proceeded to leave, he loudly and arrogantly said “ have a nice day!” On my previous flight, I was assigned to an exit row seat. I’m tall, so I asked the agent at the gate for my seat to be changed to an exit row seat, if possible (same question that I had earlier when I was checking in). She wasn’t nice either. She said “yeah, if you want to pay more”. I said that I didn’t realize that because I didn’t pay anything extra for the exit row on my departure flight. The agent asked me if I minded taking it. She said, “well, it cost more money because people want those seats”. I am happy with the seat assigned to me. But, I expected much more from American Airlines.";NEGATIVE

My best flight however was the one from Boston to New York on a transcontinental A321. I got a comfortable seat in the business-class section for this short 40-minutes-hop into JFK. But it was the captain who made this flight so special. As it was a clear and beautiful day he encouraged the passengers to look out of the window. And they actually did so. The Captain went as far as pointing out some sights en route and commenting on them. It was like flying in the 1980s when inflight entertainment on shorthaul flights was non-existent. After landing the entire crew - including the two pilots - stood in front of the cockpit and wished everybody a nice weekend.

I admit that I was frustrated and worried because I was having trouble connecting to the CLT wi-fi to let my family know I was stranded (and I had never been stranded before), but even so, the lack of sympathy from the American Airlines staff was just staggering. The staff at the service desk talked more to each other than they did to me, and eventually handed me a scrap of paper with a 1-888 number for Travelassist and told me to go call the number. No empathy, no vouchers for food or shelter to help me along. And when I called the Travelassist number, they told me that all the hotels were booked and to call back in 2 hours to see if anything had come available (which is just as well, because I was so tired I gave up and booked a hotel through Expedia, and later found out that Expedia beat the ""distressed passenger rates"" AA secured by $15 per night!) When I got to the baggage claim to grab the bag I'd checked, it wasn't there, and when I asked the AA rep at the desk about it, he said that it could take 1-2 hours, and ""if my bag didn't show up in 2 hours, come back."" After an hour or so, my bag finally showed up. When I caught my rescheduled flight 2 days later, the AA staff at O'Hare were just as rude as the ones at CLT! I was not able to check in online for my connection, and only wanted someone to confirm whether I would be flying out that day, as I had a family member in Toronto waiting to pick me up and would have to message that person if I was delayed. When I went up to the desk at my gate, there was no-one there, but a young AA staff member was hovering nearby, so I asked him if he could help me. I was abruptly told by an AA crew member behind me that I had to wait for the gate attendants to show up. When they did, I went up to them to ask if they could help me, and was rudely told by the attendants (whose nametags were completely hidden by their scarves) to come back when they'd finished boarding the current flight. Other than the stewardess who grumpily loaned me a pen so I could complete my customs form, there wasn't a single American Airlines staff member I encountered who could be described as helpful, and none of them were kind or pleasant. I was a stranded student who had chosen AA so that I could come home from an academic conference a day early to save $350. Now, all the money I saved by choosing AA is gone because I received no vouchers, no guidance, no sympathy and no help. My first experience with American Airlines, which spanned multiple airports, showed me how rude, unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service people can be.

On our way back the layover was actually only about 30 minutes in that same airport! Our Miami to Phoenix flight was unfortunately 15 minutes late. And we discovered upon final decent (landing) that we were already 15 minutes past boarding time for next flight by the time that our plane was touching down in Phoenix! Our stewardess let us know this is a common problem for this airport and directed us to the AA magazine so we could familiarize ourselves with the airport and see which way we need to run. We waited for the airplane door to open, ran out first (since we were first class) and ran through the Phoenix airport from our arrival gate, two terminals away to departure gate. When we got there, the door was shut, and there were 5 other people there who didn’t make it from other connecting flights besides ours. Everyone was complaining considering the plane was still right there. It didn’t leave for another 20 minutes or so but it didn’t matter. Upon getting to the customer service line, as the group of us did, there were others there complaining about the same issue. By our turn all the flights to the Bay Area for the night we’re full.

Once at the carousels to pick up our luggage, we were told our luggage had actually made the flight. Then we were told we should have asked for a food voucher and we should go back. At this point we were 15 plus minutes down the airport and we’re too frustrated to go back. When getting to the airport the next morning, we were told first class was full. The plane was full and we were not even going to be sitting near each other. So much for the extra money for first class! Horrible experience and customer service. Another thing is on one of our earlier flights, we watched the luggage being literally thrown mid air from a luggage cart to conveyer belt.";NEGATIVE

Now I’ll be stuck here in Chicago for 2 days which will result in thousands of dollars in lost revenue for my business. Not to mention the checked bag they lost along the way as well.

Tried reserving these seats and it kept saying error please try again. Come to find out, I was charged every single time I retried to book the seat which left me with $1 in my account. AE was no help, was on the phone with them over 3 times to cancel the transaction and report the issue. They stated they'd cancel but that the money wouldn't be sent back to my account for up to 3 business days. And then when we were rescheduled to leave, they have maintenance issues and the flight was delayed over an hour. Our connecting flight took off 45 minutes after we were supposed to land so I brought this concern to the employee at the desk. He laughed and stated rudely ""all you Miami folks are nervous Nelly's. I need you to be patient."" And then when the flight was delayed again the worker asked another co-worker if she could help find the Miami connecting folks a different flight and she loudly stated ""I really don't want to!"" And they both laughed. Very unprofessional experience which has left me knowing to never fly American again. Weather/maintenance is one thing for delays (I understand this) however this whole experience is way more than the delay.

But nowhere on the American website does it state that any personal item that has wheels and a handle is not considered a personal item even if the measurements are less than required. On my flight, as I was getting ready to board I was basically held hostage before I could board because my personal item had a handle and wheels and that is considered a carry-on. Not only did I pay a baggage fee, I was assessed a penalty fee for a total of $60. If the website had stated that I wouldn’t have bothered purchasing an underseat wheeled bag that was under the size requirment.

american-airlines;2018-04-12;" |  Jacksonville to Tucson via Dallas. This is a story about what happens when you are a Platinum Million Miler with American Airlines and you pay full fare for three first-class tickets for your family, booking through AAVacations and one of your family gets bumped by an air marshal. Spoiler alert: To stop you tweeting they mollify you with ""Our AA Vacations team will be able to help out with a refund once your travel is complete."" And once your travel is complete, the AAVacations team tells you they cannot issue refunds and sends you into a bureaucratic maze designed to punish you until you surrender. Here's the back story: First know that there were two marshals sitting in a 9-passenger first-class cabin on the dangerous passage between JAX and DFW. My petite wife ended up taking our displaced son's seat 20A because she was the only one who could fit into it--an unhappy way to start a $7K ""luxury vacation."" 20A is the seat opposite the aft cabin lav on a CR9 RJ900 aircraft. Her seatmate, a small elderly woman who also paid full-fare for a first-class seat, had been displaced by a second air marshal. More, so that the two air marshals could sit silently together, ever vigilant, one played poker and the other solitaire on their phones - my son and I were split up and placed as far apart as possible and still be in the same cabin. Having flown many millions of miles on many carriers, I suspected that not everyone in First had paid full fare for their ticket, so far in advance of boarding we asked the gate agent to look into the possibility of getting us back into our original seats, together three across. Subsequently, she managed to avoid my requests for updates until just before boarding when she advised that ""No one had volunteered to give up their seat"" and attempted to foist a $300 voucher on us as compensation, adding ""There's nothing else I can do."" Not true. When you do finally arrive at your vacation destination, American has managed to lose your bag. Now I understand that this happens, but how did they lose only one of the four bags we checked and why did it have to be my wife's bag? The following morning they delivered the bag to the Westin La Paloma, where we enjoyed a terrific week. The good folks at Westin took it upon themselves to make up for the lack of customer care and service from AA and AAVacations.";NEGATIVE

They try and make you pay to pick your seat if you are in basic economy or else they will assign you one. I choose to let them assume because on the app it said all available seats were for purchase. I board the aircraft and they have roughly 30 open seats and i am able to have an entire exit row. I land in Charlotte NC for my connecting flight and they charge me $50 to check my bag at the gate because I’m the last group to board and the overhead bin is full. Asheville allowed me to check my bag complimentary at the gate for an even smaller aircraft. The staff was incredibly rude and did not care that $50 is a lot of money for people.

american-airlines;2018-04-10;" | Akron to Birmingham via Philadelphia. Flight: 5243 March 23, 2018 from CAK to PHL First, we would like to thank the flight crew for their efforts to make a bad situation better and to resolve the unfortunate miscommunication with flight maintenance. Our understanding of the issue provided by the pilot was that there was some discrepancy with the flight maintenance log and that someone from maintenance would need to review and approve it before we could take off. The plane had been at the gate for over an hour before we boarded, and no maintenance was performed. We were informed that flight maintenance needed 30 minutes to resolve the issue, which turned into an additional 30+ plus minutes. At this point we have missed the original departure schedule but the crew was told it would be resolved in another 30 minutes and we could make up some time due to tail winds. Because of the delay sitting on the tarmac passengers were offered to deplane with the knowledge that they could not board again. Apparently, a passenger that only spoke Russian did deplane not realizing she could not return. She was very upset and in tears when she was allowed back on the plane, which, unfortunately impacted the departure time. At this point we had been on hold for more than two hours and it was clear we would miss our connecting flight from Philadelphia to Birmingham. Since there were no more flights to Birmingham that evening we were provided rooms at the Airport Wyndham hotel, comfortable at this point due to our exhaustion, but nowhere near a three-star hotel as advertised. We didn’t fly Spirit Airlines because of bad reviews, now we have one to tell regarding our experience with American Airlines. The situation seems like it could have been avoided with better communications and if flight maintenance would have done their required repairs before we boarded the flight. Lastly, “providing dinner and breakfast” does not mean vouchers that can only be used in the airport fast food court.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2018-04-10;" |  Orlando to Kahului. Customer service training must happen or happen more frequently. I have flown many times on business trips and with my family. I have never experienced what we experienced this trip. Our flight to Florida was okay. On our way back home, we were checking in at the Orlando Airport. A AA agent told us that we had to check in our Sit & Stand stroller. We told her that it was never a problem coming and all the past times we traveled. She said that at this airport, we had no choice and had to check it in. I went to ask another AA agent. I politely said, ""Good morning Maam"" to get her attention. She looked at me and said, ""Uuuggg"", you are the second person that called me Maam today! What do you want?"" I looked at her and said, ""I'll ask someone else"". Can you imagine the things you need to carry while traveling with two children? This made it very difficult to travel with two young children to say the least. When passing through TSA, we asked what the deal was and they said, it was okay with TSA. They check and allow any type of stroller. We got up to our gate and we saw one family on the flight before us who had the same exact Sit & Stand stroller and had no questions asked and strolled right into the jet way. I asked the agent, why the family before us was allowed and why we had to check our stroller in. She stated that it must have been missed. I found that hard to believe as another family checked in a double stroller (wider and more bulky than what we had). I looked around and noticed that we were the only family without our stroller.  When we got to Texas, the AA agent was so rude. We asked if our family could sit closer together. She asked for my boarding pass. Since my wife had it, I asked if I could show her a picture on my phone. She looked at me and said, ""I don't want to hold you phone. Phones are full of germs."" I didn't want her to hold my phone anyway, but what a thing to tell a guest. Phones could be full of germs, but you don't need to say that to a guest. There are many ways to politely respond and assume someone is giving you their phone to hold.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-04-09;" | Our flight was canceled because of snow-fine, no one can control the weather. The issue is in what happened after our flight was canceled. We were rebooked on a flight for the next morning, that would have taken us from NY to Boston, and then to Miami - a total of about 6 hours travel the next day. I called the 800# for AA to talk to someone about rebooking for something, anything that would get us into Miami that day, so we would not have to waste 2 entire days of our 5 day break (while also wasting hotel nights, and other things we'd planned). When I spoke to the person on the 800# she told me that there were no more flights leaving JFK, Newark, or LaGuardia, going to Miami that day. And maybe this was true for direct flights. I asked if there were any other options whatsoever, with flights going elsewhere that might then connect to Miami that day. She told me there were no other options. I asked, point blank, ""So you're telling me that no more flights are arriving in Miami for American Airlines for the rest of the day?"" She told me the only option was for this flight we had been rebooked. I then went to a counter to try to get on a standby list for an AA flight that was full, and going to Miami. Seeing a growing line of upset people, the attendant at the counter actually made an announcement that he could not help anyone who had been booked for the 6.45 canceled flight. I spoke to him anyway. I, again, asked if there were any options at all that would get us to Miami via American. He told me he was just too busy to help me. I'd like you to meditate on this for a moment: an AA service representative told me that he was too busy to help me, a customer whose paid flight on American Airlines for himself and his family to go away for spring break had just been canceled. We went to another AA gate for a later Miami flight to try to get on the standby list. At this gate we spoke to a gentleman. He was very pleasant, added us to the standby list, and then we sat. A few minutes later, he me up to the counter and said he could get us on a flight to Chicago, and from there we could pick up a flight to Miami. I was somewhat incredulous after a) being told that there were no options by the AA ""service"" rep on the phone, and b) being told that by another AA ""service"" rep that he was ""too busy"" to help me. So I asked him to confirm that we would have guaranteed seats to Chicago, and then to Miami. He said yes, and that we'd get in around 9pm. It worked-we made it to Chicago, then Miami, and ultimately only lost 1 day, arriving at our hotel in Miami almost exactly 12 hours late. But we did not lose a hotel night, and we did not have to reschedule anything else. This man saved our vacation. The rest of the AA staff and system is rigid, inflexible, and robotic, and do not try to help customers. They seem perfectly okay with unhappy, sad, disappointed and angry customers. Maybe they see it all the time and are numb to it. Maybe they need better training, maybe they take too much garbage from some customers who no doubt act like jerks. We did not act like jerks because we respect people trying to do their jobs. But we don't respect organizations that foster a culture where most staff clearly don't care about customers and only do the bare minimum for their jobs.

I was bumped to a new flight which missed my connection, bought myself and my toddler a motel for the night, only to arrive in the morning to be told I needed to purchase a new ticket in order to reach my final destination.

We  paid for our baby to have his own seat which the computer couldn’t figure out. The airline doesn’t employ enough staff to have anyone to help with the computer kiosks, so we had to wait in a long, slow line to speak to a person. 45 minutes later, we dealt with an agent who was extremely rude and unhelpful. She said it was too late to check bags, so my husband had to leave the airport with our checked bags while I did my best with a long security line. I asked if I could be moved through quicker. One agent said yes and another said no. I wasn’t able to get rushed through, even though I informed security that I would likely miss my flight. I had to sprint through the airport to my gate with a crying baby, only to find that the gate had been closed. The attendant said she would “check to see” if we could still get on, but I saw her from the window chatting with other people while the plane started rolling away from the gate. I approached customer service about this and said I had to get back to the DC area tonight. The woman said there were “no available flights tonight” even though I found one online with a seat in first class. She didn’t even give me the option to pay extra for that.

american-airlines;2018-04-03;" |  My family and I had the misfortune of taking a connecting flight from La Guardia through Miami to get to Belize (a number of people on our flight were Belize bound, and others were St Thomas bound). We experienced one and a half hour delays on the day of our flight, first due to a problem by maintenance bringing the plane from the hanger to the gate, and then with baggage loading since we'd missed our scheduled boarding time. Though the pilot tried to make up time (45 minutes), American Airlines, knowing it was a flight full of connecting passengers, and that people like my husband were Platinum Executive, chose to ground us for 30 minutes because they'd made the decision to re-sell our seats after the mishap AA caused at LGA during our one and a half hour delay. It cause many of us to miss our connecting flights, which were the last flight of the day. Perhaps worse is that the pilot and flight attendants made announcements that those on our flight not connecting should remain seated because they were holding our flights. My kids and I ran 20 gates to arrive at our connecting gate 12 minutes before scheduled departure and were refused entry to the plane because the gate agent told us he had already sold our seats (we were meeting friends on the connecting flight who told us that they sold our seats 50 minutes before scheduled departure). What is worse is that we incurred many expenses by missing 24 hours of our vacation including hotel, tour group, private shuttle, plus hotel in Miami last minute during spring break. The airline has said they've officially classified it as ""Air Traffic Control"" even though the pilot repeatedly told us there was an issue getting our plane from the hanger (it didn't come from another city) and that there was a problem loading baggage. We never waited on the tarmac, except after we landed when he said AA didn't have a gate open. The airline treated us like prisoners and unethically chose to profit from our delay caused by maintenance and baggage in NY by re-selling our seats. I would not ever recommend an airline that makes decisions to screw over passengers in this manner. Its unethical and means bad management is at the heart of it.";NEGATIVE

I was willing to pay for the luggage fees (despite being in business on JAL from JFK) and begged to have them check them all the way through. No go. After this, the flight up to JFK was delayed and the prognosis wasn’t good early on. While trying to get help from a gate agent for rebooking options, I was yelled at! In the end, as a seasoned traveler, I made had to make complicated arrangements to make sure I could get the following day’s connection. The terminal at JFK is substandard as well. The gates are far from the check-in and there are not enough TSA agents working. This is only the second time I’ve flown this routing from Japan to RDU and both times there was only ONE TSA lane open for the entire American Airlines terminal! People were going ballistic! In short, the customer service level of American Airlines is disgraceful and disgusting. Shouting at passengers, unwilling to check bags on partner airlines internationally, delays, and shabby aircraft all made for a horrible experience with them. I’ll never fly them again.

Then we sat on the plane until 9:30 when we started out of the tarmac and began to taxi and the pilot came over and said the check engine light has came on again, we will need to return to the gate. 30 min later he advised us that United Airlines were in our gate and we were stuck on the tarmac. At 11:00 PM the pilot said we will give everyone an opportunity to deboard the plane, but within 1-2 min after the announcement the pilot came back on the intercom and stated they needed to do a quick engine test and that all passengers were to remain seated, only those in first class had the opportunity to deboard. Those passengers including myself who were still in the process of deboarding were directed back to our seats. Then at 11:45 the staff announced we have another problem, we sat so long we needed refueled but the staff put the fuel in the wrong tank making us unequally balanced, so fuel had to be taken out and placed in the center fuel tank. At 12:30-1 we finally left Hawaii, once at Dallas we had more delays, after missing 3 connections we then headed to a gate with a Chicago destination but unfortunately they did not put my girlfriend on the flight. We were waiting again, they then rerouted us to a direct flight to Indianapolis, we had to run to get there and once again we had a 3 hour mechanical delay. The trip is now over 24 hours and we were not served a meal the entire time, there were no vouchers given for the time inconvenience, no food vouchers as only snacks were offered in the period of 6:30 PM Sunday to 6:30 PM Monday with no time in between to eat a hot meal due to all the missed connections and literally running to the next flight to be only delayed again. In all this after many emails to customer service they only provided ""I'm sorry you had a bad experience, we hope we can do better the next time if you choose to fly with us again and offered only 15K air miles which is the equivalent of maybe $150, when I spent 100K air miles for this trip. Their defensive responses to emails were very inaccurate, unprofessional, condescending and overall poor customer service response was a perfect representation of how I was treated on the flights with American. The lack of a caring, empathetic, customer first attitude is rampant in American Airlines.

When I got to gate 25C the two people are the gate didn’t acknowledge me so my brother said something and they told us to be quiet. They were so rude to us, I couldn’t believe it. Turns out they over booked the flight by 5 seats so they gave away our seats that we paid for because they double messed up. My brother is 6’4 and picked an isle seat because of his bad knees. They gave him a middle seat, but because of some kind passengers we were able to switch seats for him. I ended up sitting in the very back of the plane. When giving us our new seat arrangements, they wrote mine on a piece of paper and just quickly told him his. When he asked them to repeat it the lady told him to check his boarding pass because they were on there but she took his boarding pass. American Airlines acts like they’re above treating people like people. it makes my skin crawl. I will not forget how that lady looked at me with her smug face. I paid $500 for this flight and I felt like I didn’t matter. I will never fly this airline again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-03-30;" |  Los Angeles to Philadelphia. I don’t know where to start. I’ve become so disgusted with American Airlines lately. My husband and I travel very often. He’s Executive Platinum with American and travels well over 100k miles a year. I’ve been considering switching airlines due to the terrible customer service we’ve been receiving. We spend too much money to not be treated well. The last 3 trips we’ve taken have been hell. We had to call customer service multiple times to check in and get out tickets corrected. Every agent told us they were going to fix the problem but of course never did so we ended up almost missing flights because of it. Our return flight 3/29/18 was a disaster. We had a 30 minute delay leaving Philly so ended up missing our connection at 2:30. They put up on the standby list for one flight and also booked us for another flight. We ended up having to get on the second flight which was due to leave at 6:50pm from Dallas but ended up being delayed until 9:00pm. It was such a disaster. We lost our upgrade due to the delayed flight and having to switch flights. We had to travel 3.5 hours uncomfortably. We were suppose to make it back to LAX by 4:54 and didn’t return until 10:30pm. Ive about had it with American Airlines. If there not going to treat us right, then we will definitely be taking our money elsewhere.";NEGATIVE

Upon getting my boarding pass for my flight I was told that I had to check my personal bag because I had a fanny pack, which goes around the waist so I don’t see what the issue was. Only had cash on me so I had to pay an additional $5 to get a card to use to check my bag. Then when seated on the plan an attendant rudely told a bigger male passenger that he should have had enough to fly first class for a bigger seat because his seatbelt couldn’t buckle. There were plenty of empty seats on the plane so I asked to move up into one as she was letting others do so and was told no. I was all the way in the second to last row 33b. I had the worst experience on that flight.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-03-28;" | When we tried checking in, my husband and I discovered that we were not seated together.

Will not be flying with American Airlines again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-03-28;" | Los Angeles to Narita. Main Cabin Extra - Was pleasantly surprised by American Airlines. This was my first time flying AA on a long-haul flight. Inflight meal was great. Shortly after take off, drinks and snack service followed by dinner then midflight snack of sandwich and oat bar then lastly, another hot meal prior to landing. Food amount for each service was adequate. Food tasted awesome. The IFE works really good. Response time is quick and tons of material to choose from. The legroom in the Main Cabin Extra is quite spacious. I can only imagined a 6’ tall person will be very comfortable in this section. The cabin itself was clean, neat and smells fresh. FA’s smiles a lot and very friendly and moves quickly during the meal services. The whole experience was truly amazing and will definitely recommend it to my friends and clients.";POSITIVE

I was served a plate with hummus, nuts and and an absurdly small portion of crackers. I am allergic to nuts, so I asked to substitute the nuts for a second portion of crackers. I was told that was impossible. The attendant was curt and rude and hid in the corner playing games on her iPad. Wifi is not included and the gogo pay for play took over an hour to get sorted out on my devices. Totally not worth the time required, let alone the money. The plane also did not have any USB outlets or 110V outlets, even in first class! I just got off an Alaska Airlines prop plane that had outlets in coach! I will never fly American Airlines again. I recommend no one else waste their time with American Airlines either.";NEGATIVE

I was apprehensive that there would be no aircraft or crew to operate the flight from Toronto to JFK. My fears were misplaced. The plane was at the gate. The plane departed on schedule and arrived on schedule. It was a smooth flight and the flight attendant served beverages and pretzels. We had to drop off our larger carry on bags on a trolley on the apron before climbing the stairs on to the plane. They were promptly available at the top of the jet bridge at JFK when we arrived. Having cleared US immigration and customs at Toronto, we walked straight out of the terminal. This is what flying should be - on schedule, hassle free, competent crew.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2018-03-26;" | Flew Dallas to San Diego. American Airlines customer service has gotten worse over the past year, and it is unfortunate. This last trip, I had an issue with my luggage, which was my fault, but the customer service to help me remedy the situation was dismal. 5/6 people I spoke to in various capacities were all unfriendly, misinformed and not helpful. To make matters worse, I saw various other people throughout my adventure of acquiring my bags having a similar experience. Once lady coming to the US from Australia for a funeral had the bag-checker say ""give me the bag, we fly everywhere"" without tagging it, of course it was lost. In short, I would like people to know that American Airlines economy class is now comparable to Spirit Airlines in terms of accommodations and worse customer service.";NEGATIVE

It’s 4:15 and we are still unsure of our departure time. There was an issue with the plane, so understandably they had to find a new aircraft. However, since they resolved that issue, the pilot has been late, they have been unable to find flight attendants, and now - right before our supposed departure time of 4:25 - have to refuel the plane. Things happen of course, but the negligence and failure of AA to resolve these issues as quickly as possible is undeniable. This is also not the first time I have experienced significant delays on the airline. Furthermore, they have failed to give frequent updates to the passengers of what is going on as well as offer assistance to passengers with connecting flights. If you decide to travel with American, don’t expect to reach your destination at the stated time.";NEGATIVE

They cancelled my first flight (which took two days away from my vacation) then the day of my rescheduled flight they delayed my flight by 2 hours which made me miss my connecting flight, so now instead of reaching for 1pm, I am now reaching for 8pm. To make things worst they had us moving from gate 5 to gate 2 just to go back to gate 5. I hate American Airlines - first and last time ever booking with them. They are beyond unprofessional. You knew about this flight weeks in advance, why are you doing a maintenance check at 7:40 a.m.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-03-24;" | Flew American Airlines from Madison to Salt Lake City. The over booking of my flight made me miss my bachelorette party. They originally rescheduled me on a red-eye to arrive an hour before I was supposed to get married. The automated service which called only said “say yes to confirm” with no other option. I just said no because that was completely unacceptable. We had a reservation for our wedding at a specific time and we couldn’t rebook. Luckily the automated service understood the word no and took me to an unsympathetic person who did manage to book me to fly in around 1 am. My now-husband and I got about three hours of sleep before our wedding. Luckily my wedding dress managed to change flights and arrive with me, but the person I spoke with on the phone wouldn’t guarantee that my dress would arrive at the time we spoke, so I was very upset and anxious during the entire experience.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-03-23; |  Washington to Boston. We fly regularly from Walter Reed to Boston for medical reasons for my husband. He’s a wounded warrior and uses an electric wheelchair. There were issues loading his chair. The ground staff told me he didn’t want his guys lifting something So heavy so they would let another crew put it on another flight meaning we would have to wait an hour without his chair after landing. Our captain went down to talk to them and they told him it was too big to fit. He told them he knew it would and it needed to be on the flight. He went out of his way to make sure it was loaded. When we landed he also made sure the ground staff brought the chair down the jetway which was something they didn’t want to do. He went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care. Our flight Attendant was also amazing and took great care of us. For domestic flights we only fly American Airlines because their flight staff is the best by far.;POSITIVE

I took my boyfriend on a trip for his birthday and going to Florida (out of New York JFK) the employees were unnecessarily rude to multiple customers and then coming back (MCO to LGA) they were just as bad. First, the lady that was supposed to be helping guests on the kiosks completely disappeared for about 15 minutes which led me to ask someone else for help which then resulted in being extremely rude. We then almost missed our flight (even though we arrived at the airport about 2 hours prior to our boarding time) so we had to run to the gate. When I asked the flight attendant for water because I have asthma and couldn’t breathe I was denied it. Terrible customer service.";NEGATIVE

My flight was purchased from Raleigh to Miami, when I arrived I was told overhead space was full so they would have to check my bag in free of cost. After the lady placed the tag on my bag she said to me you can pick this up from Orlando. I explained to her it needed to go to Miami not Orlando, after her checking her information she explained to me that it might have been a ""glitch"" in the system and the only way I was getting my bag was to go to Orlando. This is absolutely asinine that I had to purchase a new ticket, the customer service is horrific. Clearly everyone hates their jobs and does care about the problems or issues you encounter while flying with them. Then on my flight back they could not locate my flight that my account was charged $400 for. The flight wasn't located but of course the payment was received. I had lost my phone on the trip and didn't have access to my email however, I was able to pull up the confirmation that was not found on there end with my payment attached. I spent together on one flight over $1000 for a mistake on their end claiming it was a ""glitch"". Honestly this made me never want to fly again the experience was horrible and customer service did nothing to facilitate the process I faced.";NEGATIVE

I will not fly with them again. ;NEGATIVE

Excellent legroom, substantial seat width, great entertainment, and veery comfortable seats. Food, service, and amenity kit are just good, not great.

On that note, I cannot stress how excellent and recommended the bulkhead seats are.";POSITIVE

The short sector from Las Vegas to Los Angeles was boarded quickly and a beverage service (bottle of water or juice) was provided. For such a short flight (45 minutes) this was a pleasant surprise. The sector from Los Angeles to Hong Kong was completely full but boarded quickly. The service on board was fantastic, catering has improved light years since my last international journey with the old AA in 2011. 5 spice Asian Beef in economy was a major treat. Non stop beverage services, all journey self serve snack buffet in the galley, hot pizza snack mid flight and large hot breakfast just before landing. Entertainment choices onboard are plentiful. Flight crew were very well groomed in new uniforms and professional, courteous and available for the entire 14 hour journey. I was sworn off of the old AA but I am so very impressed by what I experienced on the new American Airlines this week that I can see myself renewing my Admirals Lounge membership and coming back to American Airlines for my flying.

Arriving at my destination no carry on! They only knew that my bag didn't make it on the flight, that it would be arriving with another flight they don't know when. I spent 3 weeks in PaP calling everyday going back in forth to the airport which was 45 min away from where I was staying. Terrible customer service, terrible communication. In the end they asked me to file a Customer property Questionnaire in order to get reimbursed for the lost bag.

I have been using this airline to fly my children from Utah to NY for several years. This weekend and 3 weekends ago I had 2 different incidents with my 15 year old. Traveling by herself it was alarming to hear she did not make her flights (both times). American Airlines went above and beyond to accommodate her to make sure she was safe and well taken care of. They arranged another flight for her and kept me posted each time. They took good care of her as well as myself (who as you can imagine was filled with worry). I will continue using them with the trust that my family will always be safe and well taken care of. ;POSITIVE

Several AA employees speaking unprofessionally at the gate and running around somewhat frantically. Then I hear my gate was reassigned.

american-airlines;2018-03-03;" | Nashville to Savannah via Charlotte. I bought two round-trip tickets to SAV, the flights to Savannah were great and we had no problems what so ever. The problem was on the way home when they pushed our connecting flight up by 40 minutes while we were in flight to Charlotte. I don't understand how the crew can make that decision to move a flight up by 40 minutes, meaning we missed our connecting flight which was also the last flight of the night at 11:15pm. When I called AA support she informed me that the plane didn't actually leave the ground until 11:29 pm and there is no reason they shouldn't have let us on the plane. She then said to tell the agent that we need hotel vouchers to which the agent said ""no sorry we can't"" and the representative on the phone was baffled at her response. All of us that missed our connecting flight were then kicked out of 2 terminals, no hotel, no food or water, offered to us. The AA agents in the SAV airport did provide us with snacks and drinks for our 2 hour delay so I was astonished that nothing was provided for a 12 hour delay. We were not put on another flight until 8:55 am the following morning meaning we had extra fees charged for storing our cars, missing work, and sitters. What makes me even more mad is I filed a claim with AA claims department and they sent me back the most ""we don't care"" email. Saying that AA feels that their customers should have to pay for extra cost such as hotels, transportation, parking fees, storage fees, and any other fees that we were charged for missing our flight due to the airline changing their times. I have never felt so disrespected by a company as much as I have with American Airlines. I was not asking for my full refund because 3 out of 4 of my flights were great and the crew was awesome except for CLT and the service I have been given so far. All I wanted was my extra fees reimbursed. Very disappointed with how we were all treated. I had booked all my upcoming flights with American Airline and have since cancelled every last one of them, I would never want someone else to be treated the way we were.";NEGATIVE

Over the course of two flights (roundtrip) we contacted American Airlines customer service about 7-8 times both over the phone and in person at the airport (customer service desk, gate agent) all regarding the same issue. They all gave us different answers and in some cases flat out incorrect information. We had issues with seats, with bags, but most importantly - when people are paying - any amount of money for that matter - you address their concerns in some way. After this awful travel experience we contacted their corporate customer service and got basically - sorry - can't help, fly with us again please. Even worse they clearly didn't even read the complaint. In the response they addressed the wrong issue and claimed I was travelling with my wife (I was travelling with my husband). Their lack of concern for customers is evident in the fact that they can't even read their emails fully. The whole process has just been incredibly frustrating - this business should be ashamed of themselves.";NEGATIVE

By the time we were able to check on availability of hotel rooms we found that there were none left. No suggestions or assistance had been offered but we made the decision to split our party into two and were able to obtain slightly earlier flights for the children and their parents but this still involved a nine wait for a connecting flight at Chicago and arriving at LHR instead of LGW.

Later on the plane I was seated in the exit row. The plane was not full and apparently this lady and her companion were not seated together. The aisle seats in the exit row were both open. This pair moved into these seats. I fully expected the flight attendant to make them move because someone wheeled onto a plane is obviously not physically capable of helping anyone in an emergency. She did not. While I'm not a body builder, I am capable of lifting that 45 lb door and assisting others. These two obviously are not.

american-airlines;2018-02-28;" |  Phoenix to Yuma. The man in seat in front of me was in row 1 of first class (It was a very tiny plane and the upgrade was only $59 so I was treating myself). Passenger 1 was jovial and talkative and showed me a paper cutout of ""Flat Stanley"". (http://www.flatstanleyproject.com/) He was taking photos and videos of Stanley everywhere for his 6yr old daughter. While we were waiting to leave the gate, I heard him talking and asked if he was talking to Flat Stanley. He said that no, he was taking a video of him on the plane for his daughter. One of the stewardesses yelled at him to shut it off. He asked why and explained that he was videoing this doll for his daughter. She was rude and demanding and made him shut off the camera saying he was not allowed to video staff. (Is that even a thing? I can't imagine it's a thing). The passenger complied but was talking to us other passengers and commenting when she was around that she was violating his rights and she might not have a job after he talked to the airline. I said she was probably having a bad day and he should just let it go. When we landed, the doors did not open. A man came up from the back of plane. He was dressed plainly. (jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt, I think it was.) I saw handcuffs hanging from his belt on the small of his back. He stepped into the cockpit with cranky stewardess and shut the door. The next thing I know, ""officer"" is demanding me to get out of my seat and making me stand in the aisle by the stewardesses. It is important to note that he did not identify himself to me or show me a badge. He ordered me around and informed Passenger 1 that he needed to sit there and me to wait. I asked the ""officer"" if he needed me as a witness because I saw it all and this was a horrible misunderstanding. He didn't want to talk to me and did not want my info. I could tell this was looking very bad for Passenger 1. I hastily wrote my name and number on a piece of paper from my purse and gave it to Passenger 1 and offered my help if he needed. When I was told I could deplane, Passenger 1 was still being held inside, He asked if he could take my picture so he could text it to his family so they could find me to let them know what was going on. When I deplaned there were police outside talking to the captain. Turns out, the stewardess said that Passenger 1 threatened her! I was shaking I was so angry at the lie and the injustice. I gave the officers my information and told them what happened. I waited in the airport and Passenger 1 finally came out. He was released and the officers told me all was dismissed. I cannot express strongly enough how angry and horrified I was that in United States of America, we were badgered and pushed around (By a man who did not even bother to identify himself) all because some American Airlines stewardess lied about a passenger and could have caused an innocent man to be on a do-not-fly list or worse, go to jail. To this day, I do not know Passenger 1’s name. He was a stranger to me. But he was unjustly detained and put at personal risk by American Airlines and I hope all is well with him today.";NEGATIVE

Spent the day flying from San Francisco to Charlotte, NC, hung out in a restaurant for my three hour layover, then showed up at my gate for my one hour trip home. Gate was moved. Went to the new gate, 2 hour 15 minute delay! I could drive home and get there sooner, except they can’t give me my bags for over an hour. If they had simply told me it was delayed via email before spending three hours in a restaurant waiting on my flight, I would’ve rented a car and would be home right now, instead of in this miserable airport waiting on another 1 1/2 hours to pass (at this point). My wife and I each have AA mileage cards, and you can bet my first order of business when I get home will be to cancel those suckers.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2018-02-26;" | Flew American Airlines from Santa Ana to Philadelphia via Dallas Fort Worth. I missed my scheduled flight and had to rebook, the representative at the airport put me on standby for a flight several hours later, telling me that I would ""probably get on."" However, the flight was full, and after waiting around for over three hours I rebooked for the following day. I arrived at the airport two hours early this time, only to find my first flight had been delayed by two hours. I received a message on my phone that this might cause me to miss my connection in Chicago, so I attempted to change flights via mobile website. However, upon submission it displayed an error message about the action not being completed. So I decided to wait, hoping the delay wouldn't make me miss my connection. Unfortunately, despite what the online booking told me, they had in fact given my seat on the first flight away. The attendants were very helpful and I was able to get onto a flight to Dallas Fort Worth, where I could pick up a connection home. But this new flight was full enough that I was required to check my carry-on. The flight was fine but when I arrived in Dallas, I found my connecting flight wasn't for another hour. I settled in to wait, but after only half an hour or so, it was announced that the flight had been delayed by two more hours. And because I was forced to check my bag, I had no way of changing to an earlier flight. The staff were nice enough to put out some drinks and snacks, but I'm unsure of whether that was organized by American or by the airport. The second flight had no in-flight entertainment or even an outlet, though the staff were pleasant. Overall not a great flight experience. I don't think I will be flying with American again without having done some thorough research first.";NEGATIVE

Boarding was slow because everyone was being asked if they wanted to check in their carry-on as they scanned in. We had two seats in Main Cabin Extra, bulkhead. The big problem was that AA did not have any bassinets so the aisle passenger, not in our party, had to hold the baby. She was fuming because she asked at check in to make sure it was there. It’s hard traveling with babies I know but she really did encroach on my space the whole way. My fault gambling on the bulkhead. Flight attendants went through the motions but didn’t care much.

In the 15 minutes it took my wife to come back we then tried to check in and were told we missed out flight due to a 30 minute check in requirement. Then we were told the next flight they would put us on was 8 hours later even though I offered to pay more to get on one of the many flights leaving much sooner. Had she told us about the 30 minute cut off to check in I could have checked in while waiting for my wife to return and been on my flight.

I have rarely been so pleasantly surprised. First flight out of Heathrow, and biz class, due to no First Class on this airplane I had a seat on my own, which was great. The AA biz seat isn't anything special per se, in a global context, but is certainly vastly superior to British Airways Club Class, and even better than British Airways First Class. Food was acceptable, slightly better than mediocre. The purser handling Business Class was excellent, and had the correct balance of professionalism, and personality to serve a Premium Cabin. The aircraft itself is still quite noisy, compared to an A-380, but it seemed to deal with mild turbulence well. So, compared to British Airways, I have to commend American Airlines internationally, (although their USA domestic product is still woeful). I will endeavour to fly American Airlines B-787 business and first class internationally over British Airways, given the choice.";POSITIVE

The pilot/copilot described the flight path while we were on the ground and alerted us to what we should look out for. I was thus lucky to be in a window seat. The tour guide role the cockpit crew played was excellent. A breakfast meal was served. Later on, snacks, soft drinks, hot drinks, and liquor were offered. Although the business class cabin was full, it was spacious and quiet. Flight attendants were attentive. The cabin had drop down TV monitors, no movie selection was available though you could choose from a range of music channels. Seats were wide and leg space ample. It might have been more relaxing if there were foot rests. We were kept informed of the progress of our flight including any holding delays near JFK. I found all this information very useful. Another well run flight by American Airlines - on time departure/arrival, helpful and informative staff, a decent meal and snacks, and clean cabin and lavatory. Given the many negative comments about the airline, it appears that there is a great deal of inconsistency in their service, in the training of their airline, and by aircraft and route. On this trip at least, I had no issues at all.";POSITIVE

Forced to check my roller at the gate due to space availability, get on the plane and there's tons of space. That annoys me to no end, and they just don't care about your personal belongings (whether you receive them and the baggage claim).

After I tagged my bag, I went to weigh it and the woman asked for my boarding pass and ID. I held it out for her and she asked again for my boarding pass and ID. I said here it is, and she said again boarding pass and ID. She would not take it or ask me to display it, she just asked for boarding pass and ID. So, I separated them and she said OK. She didn’t get a look at the ID, just saw that I had it in my hand. I could have shown her a library card as far as she knew. Then at the TSA, when I walked up to the Kiosk and held out my boarding pass and ID for the woman there she didn’t take it, she pointed to the front of the kiosk where she wanted me to stand without saying a word. I fly into PHL often and this was the worst customer service I have ever had at any airport.

I was able to switch flights to land in New Bern NC rather than OAJ, but then I had to rent a vehicle to drive an additional hour to get to my destination. In the midst of all this my flight back to Charlotte was delayed 4 times and my time with my husband was spent trying to figure out how I was to get home now since my connecting flight (last flight of the evening) was now going to be missed leaving me stranded in Charlotte. I only ended up getting to spend 1 hour with him and I do not know when I will see him again...i drove to the airport in hopes that I could get a connecting flight home but there was none...so I took the flight I had from OAJ to Charlotte and had to get yet another rental to drive 7.5 hours through the night to get home in time to head right back out to work.

American has not once, but twice lost my infant car seat, stroller, and base when flying with a 5 month old baby. My most recent flight I had checked my stroller, car seat and base at my gate, when I arrived in Dallas for my layover it was nowhere to be found. When I asked for assistance it seemed that no one working for American had any idea what they were doing. One gentleman unloading baggage was trying his best to help us by calling his supervisor who took 30-40 minutes to even answer the phone. We got sent back and forth between employees who didn't feel like dealing with us and told us things like ""I honestly have no idea how to do this"". ""Baggage claim isn't answering my calls"" and things like ""You are going to have to go back to the gate you came from I don't have time to deal with this"". The most frustrating moment was when the supervisor finally showed up 40 minutes later, meanwhile I am holding my sick, hysterical child on my hip in the airport trying not to miss my next flight that leaves in 30 minutes. The supervisor drives past us in a baggage car, not even stopping saying ""you are going to have to call baggage claim and see where it is, I don't know what to tell you, it must be lost somewhere"". It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was then told to go to my next gate and wait there so I didn't miss my next flight. So I carried my child to the opposite end of the airport with no stroller and no extra hands to carry my personal items. When I arrived at my next gate and told the new American employee what was going on she responded by saying. ""Oh, you're going to have to go back to the gate you came from. That isn't in my department since you came from a different gate"". So extremely frustrating! I then proceeded to ask the employee how she expected me and my child to get home from the airport with no car seat or base when I arrive at my final destination. She then stated that I can file a claim with American and ""maybe"" they will supply me with a used one to get home from the airport. $250 later my husband had to meet me at the airport, 2 hours from our home with a brand new car seat and base we had to purchase so that we could safely leave the airport with our child. When we arrived at our final destination we were then told our baggage had never even left the first airport we left from. American Airlines stated if they could find our items they would send them to our address. Two days later an American airline employee shows up at our house at 1am with our items! One o clock in the morning! This is one of the most ridiculous and stressful experiences I have dealt with. American not only has terrible customer service but not one of their employees was knowledgeable or accommodating to our situation. This was a nightmare and totally unacceptable! I would advise anyone to steer clear of flying American Airlines.

Arrived at Columbia early to try and get another flight because I knew weather was bad today and it was going to be bad across the country.

So, as I guessed original flight from CAE is delayed. When the aircraft arrives, absolutely no hustle by anyone to get the plane boarded. I will give props to the pilot - was ready to push off immediately and made up some time in the air. Land in Washington and have to wait for the ground crew to move equipment out of the way. Really? How does this happen when we were due in 30 minutes ago? We have to wait for all luggage to be pulled and the wait for the bus driver to take us to the terminal. No attempts made to speed anything up. Finally make it to the terminal about 2 minutes late, and no effort is made to route another bus to the plane even though there were 15+ minutes until scheduled take off. I asked to check on other flights and he said he couldn't help me as he stares at his computer in front of him. I eventually make it onto another delayed flight after finding someone with some empathy. When you know all of you're flights are late, make an effort to care and try to be prepared and efficient.

american-airlines;2018-02-02;" |  I'll keep this short and simple as to why I'm a ""one and done"" with American Airlines. Firstly, we sat in our plane on the runway way for 2 hours before taking off (being told mixed stories as to why we were delayed). We missed our connecting flight (and our upgraded seats we paid for and had to basically argue about upon arriving). When we finally got to our destination (3 hours late and missing our transportation we had paid for) our luggage was missing. The employees had zero empathy for us for our travel day from hell and handed us a form for our lost luggage (the form had a contact number which we couldn't get through to the following day after multiple attempts of calling). We were told to buy what we needed and we would be reimbursed (we had literally nothing until we got our luggage the following evening). A month after I began the reimbursement process I received a response from American Airlines stating that they don't reimburse for personal belongings due to lost luggage although it's clearly stated that they do on their website. Moral of the story when it comes to flying with American, don't do it.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2018-02-02;" | I would like to share the horrible experience that I had flying with American Airlines. I bought tickets from them to travel from Toronto to Houston and return. Toronto to Chicago to Houston (01/24/2018) Houston to Dallas to Toronto (01/29/18) The flight from Toronto to Houston was ok except for an hour delay. Everything turned into a nightmare when we were travelling back from Houston. Our flight from Houston was at 4:20PM (45 mins flight to Dallas) and our connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto was at 6:25PM (2hr 25 mins to Toronto). We got on the flight at 4:20 and we were stuck there for almost 1.5 hrs. According to the captain the air control did not give clearance and the plane had to refuel since it did not plan for the delay. After 1.5 hours they informed that we will not be able to catch our connecting flight from Dallas so it’s better to get off and re-book from Houston. We got off and asked to get our checked-in luggage. They said they cannot take that out and it will be going to Dallas. So we asked them what our options were since do not want to lose our luggage. During this time we got the notification that our flight was re-booked from Dallas at 7AM the next day (01/30/18), which meant we had to stay the night at Dallas. After discussing at the gate and with the flight crew they confirmed us that since we have a check-in baggage it will be better for us to go to Dallas and as it was an airline issue, accommodation will be provided for the night. We were convinced and agreed to get in the flight again and go for Dallas where we reached at 6:57PM (instead of 5:37PM) This is where everything started. After getting off the plane we went to talk to gate staff (as instructed) for our accommodation voucher and that is when they said ""Since it is not our fault, we will not be able to provide accommodation. In our system we see that it is coded for Tarmac delay due to clearance from Air Control which led to refueling"". We told them repeatedly that we were took off that plane and put back in and assured that there will be accommodation provided. We just had to talk to the gate. After that they said, ""Well sir, I do not see anything documented/coded in your account, therefore I cannot do anything. The best we can do is provide you hotels at distress rate"" The minimum amount of distress rate they offered was USD 65 without shuttle and if we wanted shuttle it would USD 75. Why would we pay anything? Was it our fault? We did not take their offer and the funny thing is the hotel we ended up staying “Days Inn hotel” was available on Booking.com for USD 65 with shuttle service. I do not know what kind of distress rate were they offering. You can find a copy of my hotel receipt below. We spent almost 2.5 hours travelling from Houston to Dallas and hearing them say that just made us frustrated and speechless. We were supposed to be at work the next day on 01/30/2018, so which meant 1 extra day leave from work.";NEGATIVE

First the plane had a mechanical issue that had to be fixed (good that it was) but approx 30 minutes delay. Second, the plane somehow was without a first officer or backup pilot. So we waited another 45 minutes while that person drove in from home. Third, long wait on tarmac to actually take off, I think they lost their slot in the queue as a result of the delays. No food on offer, ie included in the ticket. You could buy a box of processed meat and biscuits for $9. Great food service -  not. The staff themselves were trying.

Now originally I had been coming back on QF74 via SFO. However due to ATC issues in SFO three out of four flights leaving LAX were cancelled. Too their credit AA sorted the problem out and found a space on AA73 back to Sydney. That meant a bus ride back to T4 at LAX from one of the outlying terminals that AA uses. In addition a delay of 3 hours over the departure time of QF74. A separate review of the lounge at T4 but suffice to say I had a lot of time to kill. Books and phones help! Now the flight itself was on AA73 which is a B787 -9. Was keen to try this as it is the plane around which Qantas are building their future. Most if not all of my long haul is on the Airbus A380 with QF or EK. So the Boeing felt and was smaller.Ceilings were high and windows bit bigger but not as quiet as the Airbus. Being new everything had that new car feel to it! So the hard product is fine albeit I had better get used to it. It is the soft product where AA fails. On entering the craft the FA said: do I have to tell you where to go?  The food service was hurried and without any real warmth. I appreciate that FA's are working in cramped conditions and so will always ask an FA how his or her day is going and smile. US crews just seem not too care, its a job for them and they just do it on auto pilot. The famed US levels of service with a smile have long since gone. The seat, 24B was a nightmare. Exit row but so narrow and uncomfortable. The Boeing 787 is probably OK for flights up to 9/10 hours but beyond that I would not take it. The AA Flagship Lounge is superb and but besides that AA's soft product is just lacking.";POSITIVE

My husband and I were flying from Cancun to Charlotte and then Omaha. Our flight to Charlotte landed about ten minutes late, we then had to go through immigration, customs, and security again and make it to our next flight that was in one hour. We got through everything as quickly as we could and then ran to the gate our flight was leaving out of and had missed it by 3 minutes. The workers at that gate directed us to a service desk to help with rerouting our flight. We explained the situation to the service desk and they put us on standby on a flight in the morning and reported that they could not confirm this flight for us because missing the flight was our fault. We asked for a hotel voucher for the night and this was refused for the same reason - that missing our flight was our fault. They refused to do anything else. The plane was late, we had to wait in three lines to get to a gate on the opposite end of the terminal, and these three lines took their sweet ass time. I'm not sure how blaming your customers gets you anywhere. Notorious for delayed flights and improper service.";NEGATIVE

We took four flights with them from Heathrow to Cancun via Miami and it was consistently bad. I hated that there was a surcharge for sitting together, something you expect when you are flying with a budget airline but not transatlantic flight. The food was dreadful, I am one of those rare people who quite like airplane food, but this was not good. “Chicken or pasta” was the mantra all the way down the aisle and when I asked for more information I just got chicken or pasta repeated. How about giving a full description over the tannoy and then no need to repeat it 300 times? I genuinely did not know what I was eating, it was unrecognisable. I left almost everything apart from the water. Finally the crew, really not nice people and only one flight attendant out of all we interacted with was pleasant. Their culture is one of (almost) intimidation, very unfriendly even for a Brit. I know they are probably tired but there was a real feeling that we were a nuisance and they don’t want to offer a service - not that we used the bell once during any of their flights. My husband went up to ask for another glass of wine and was told to ‘slow down’ - not something you expect. Really couldn’t wait to get off and will not return.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2018-01-26;" | I recently traveled from Stockholm to San Juan via London and Miami. The flight from London to Miami was delayed by 40 minutes, due to which American Airlines decided to bump me off from the connecting flight - as confirmed by the customer service. Despite the delay, I would have been able to make it to the flight well before it departed. People who arrived to the gate after me were allowed to board. Later, I was told by the customer service that I was bumped off to make sure that the plane would leave on time. This seems to be in conflict with what I experienced. Instead of sending me a message about me being bumped off the flight, American Airlines sent me emails about the flight being delayed. Had I been informed on time that I was not on the flight anymore, I could have gone to the re-booking counter right away. Now I ended up going to the gate and waiting there. I tried to ask the airline why they do not inform their customers about this kind of changes and if they believe it would be appropriate to do so, but received no answer at all. I ended up spending 24 hours in Miami on standby before getting on a flight to San Juan. I was constantly told by the airline staff at the airport that people would be let to board flights in the order they appear on the standby list. Yet, many people who were behind me on the list were allowed to board before me. I was in contact with the American Airlines customer service about the depressing experience with the airline. They struggled to give me a proper explanation on why I was bumped off the flight and the overall treatment I got at the airport.

For an international flight, we purchased additional miles for $1300 so that we would have enough miles to fly “main cabin extra”. (This is an extra cost over regular coach because you get extra leg room and other benefits). Being claustrophobic, I needed the seats that we originally chose. AA changed the plane that they were going to fly to Australia (a 15.5 hour flight from LA) and took it upon themselves to move us to much worse seats in the regular coach section. My husband is a Platinum flier for life with 3 million miles flown on AA. After speaking to several supervisors at the platinum desk and writing to customer service, AA refused to do anything about it. At the very least, they should have refunded the $1300 that we had to pay to purchase extra miles in order to get the upgraded section! Shame on you American Airlines. It’s no wonder that you no longer carry an elite status in the airline industry if this is how you treat your customers who have been loyal to you for many years!

Also, the staff becomes rude when they start to tell you that you have to check in your bag, the problem I have with this is that they let certain people go and it becomes a personal judgement call rather than actually determining if someone has a larger carry on.

Some slight improvements since they ""lost"" our luggage years ago (and almost had to be sued for compensation) but still a 2 star airline. Boarding usually a shambles exacerbated by people flying with pets (dog fights at gates comical). Also people travelling with too much carry on causing huge delays. It isn't such an issue in other countries I'm not sure why such a problem with US airlines after having so many years to address the problem,. The real entertainment is usually the cabin crew, who I am sure are mostly nice people, it is just that their standard of training and presentation takes the joy out of the entire experience. Whilst all flights were pleasant enough, just walking onto a plane to see two poorly dressed flight attendants standing with their backs to you eating, instead of greeting customers is so bad it's hilarious. And it was the same for each of the seven legs we took over these three tickets. Apart from that the flights offered a variety of mediocre experiences from airplane condition to not being offered headphones in first class, but that didn't bother us as much as the dreadful presentation and complete lack of pride and professionalism. We only fly AA for the status credits to keep our Qantas Platinum (Oneworld Emerald), I hope that AA's recent image overhaul is still underway and better training standards on the horizon. Note - there isn't a Oneworld lounge at CUN and AA will not check your bags beyond USA, even though we were connecting to another Oneworld airline in biz class - Qatar (talk about chalk and cheese).

Much to my surprise, we landed at MIA 5 minutes early, only to be held on the tarmac for an hour, all because there was an aircraft still at the gate, so much for being early. So AA had a plane for an hour, on the tarmac just waiting with passengers who had connecting flights. To make matters worst being the concerned passenger I asked the head flight attendant a question, to which she had the audacity to rudely state that I should have flew in the night before. The nerve of her. After finally being able to deplane & having to scramble to G21, much to my demise the flight had already closed off, and instead of aiding assistance to an already frustrated me, the female agent rudely said we are not getting on. Seems like some of these females employed by AA need training. The male agent made it his priority to calm an already angered me. Good Job to him. He advised me that the airline would accept fault. You would think that my anger would have ended there. After being told that I would be placed in a hotel at the expense of the airline, I was given a $12 food voucher. Really American. I had to pay an additional $15 for proper food. Another Issue was the shuttle that was to take me to the hotel had me waiting 2 hours, by this time I had given up. Fast forward to Monday 15th shall we, I got to the airport thinking it would be a better day but no, here I was thinking that my first class seat 4C would still be available so I could at least have one thing to smile about.

american-airlines;2018-01-12;" | Flew from Seattle to Boston via Philadelphia. Navigating American’s area in Seattle was easy enough. We checked in at the self-serve kiosks. Boarded on time and got into the air in good time. The first leg was aboard their newly-configured Airbus A321. I was in seat 26F. The seat was pretty old on the 5-hour flight. Width felt very tight, and the legroom was made difficult by a low-hanging seat and my underseat storage occupied. Also, the streaming IFE did not work for the entire flight. Things quickly got very boring. Cabin service was on par, however the flight attendants did seem very unenthusiastic. Connection in Philadelphia was pretty simple, however we had a long walk between gates that would have been difficult with a short connection time. The flying time up to Boston was very quick. I was occupying seat 20F on the Airbus A320, and it was significantly more comfortable. The seat width was the same, but I was able to get my bag further under the seat, which allowed for greater legroom. Cabin service was better on this leg, however it was a short flight. IFE streaming was again not working properly, but it was a short hop so I didn’t mind. Overall, my experience on American got me back across the country, but the “cattle class” narrative certainly being applied. Thankfully, it wasn’t too expensive, but I expected a little more from a legacy carrier. Every LCC experience I’ve had recently has been better. But it’ll definitely get you where you need to go.";NEGATIVE

I had a flight from Norfolk to San Diego via Dallas. I arrive at my flight on time just for them to delay my flight for an hour. Finally take off and when I arrive at Dallas my flight was just now taking off. I was extremely annoyed. Had to wait in a line for up to an hour and a half since there was an absurd amount of people that missed their flight as well. Was told that my next guaranteed flight will be that next following day, but I have the option to wait for the last available flights of that night, I will just be on stand by. Waited for 3 long hours to see if me and my girlfriend can squeeze in but we got denied. I was told I was number 14 on the list but another administrator told me I was number 12 on the stand by list. Very unorganized. The only positive thing that came from this was that they gave us an hotel voucher for the night. However, I was told that my bags had already took off without me and I will have to go get them at the baggage claim when I arrive at SD. Not only that, but when I was in a line for my hotel voucher, you can even hear the customer assistance saying “I’m leaving in 2 minutes, Im going home.” Mind you there are groups of people waiting to find a place to stay that have been traveling all day long. What type of service is that? Glad to know that American Airlines care about their passengers. That next following morning I wait by the gate to board my flight that was around 06:20. Came to find out that they switched the flight to another gate number when I went to the help desk to see if I was at the right location. Thank god I asked or I would of missed out on another flight. Nobody even notified us that the gate number even had changed. What type of service is that? I will never in my life fly this company again. The apocalypse can occur and they can have the last flight to safety and I still wouldn’t take it. This company doesn’t care about anything but their wallets.";NEGATIVE

When we got to the ticket counter the (rude) woman told us they had given our seats away. My 5 month pregnant wife and I sprinted to make this flight so we could make it to our party in time. This woman could not have cared less. They gave our seats away and we were there. The customer service rep informed us that a refund would not be given because they put us on a different flight. That is completely besides the point and with any honor American would have done the right thing and given us a refund since they were the sole reason we missed our party. They were the rudest people to deal with and I will never deal with them again. There is no doubt that the rating they have is well deserved as being lowly incompetent people.

They knew that crew that was flying in will not fly back because they had to take mandatory break. Do they have any regard for their customers?‬ Nothing stopping them from charging $1,200 for economy tickets and $25 for the first checked bag on a top of that. But they feel that it's perfectly fine not to inform their passengers about the flight that won't be flying any time soon. Were they too afraid to lose some money from that ridiculas fare? This is a complete ignorance or incompetence. The way they put it ""a mistake the company made"". A mistake they said they’ve fixed already. There was a news article by major news outlet 2-3 weeks ago that American Airline granted too much PTO time to their pilots and crews for the holiday season and major service outages are expected.

Thanks to AA we missed a whole day in Punta Cana because we missed our flight to Charlotte. We missed the flight because we were waiting for staff to bring a wheelchair for my grandmother who cannot walk through an airport. When we got to the gate, staff said the plane was gone and we were 2 min late. Staff even acknowledged that the time stamp on our luggage was an hour before boarding time. We waited an hour for a wheelchair. We told them we could push the chair but they did not allow it. There was only one lady working the wheelchair area. Of course it being the holidays they could not get us to our destination that day. We flew to Charlotte that day but had to stay the night. They gave us 1 room for my grandmother since she needed the wheelchair, but we had to pay for additional rooms. I guess AA thought we could have left an old lady and got on a flight without her. We are a family! We come together and leave together! The luggage was a whole other situation. We had the AA agent check all of our luggage tickets. She ensured us that once we missed the flight our luggage did not go either. Well, my luggage was in Punta Cana without me. Once we made it to Punta Cana only 1 family member's luggage came on the belt! Total disaster and staff had no idea where it was. Everyone elses luggage eventually came and all was good. I am very disappointed in AA, we even tried to get refunds and just cancel the trip. They would not give refunds because they said it was our fault that we missed the original flight. We had travel insurance. This is the short version of what happened. The misinformation from AA agents in Cleveland, Charlotte, and Punta Cana is another story. Never again. Oh no wifi on the plane, but the flight attendants were nice. On the way home, I did have to listen to the flight attendants entire personal conversations because I was sitting in the very last row.

Had American thought of their passenger who booked months in advance, instead of stand-bys I would have made my trip in the scheduled 4hrs, instead of 18. They refused to re-fund any money.

Used AAdmirals Club lounge which was a modern and comfortable facility with a nice apron view. Received a voucher for one free ""premium drink"". Food choices were rather poor (soup, cookies, vegetables and dips and cheese cubes) and all drinks were served at the manned bar, (tips expected) except tap water, coffee and tea.

IFE was AVOD and screen size and quality very good. Content was large and varied. Headphones were provided. WIFI was available, but too slow to be useful. A chicken couscous salad (or cheese ravioli) was served for dinner, which was very bland and bordering tasteless. Service by cabin crew was good and attentive.

You would think of this as a bad coincidence, but when they did the same thing to almost every single customer in the flight, you realize that the company should not be operating in such conditions because they are not following their part of the service. Unless you want to have a reference point of what the worst service possible can be, don't even bother in checking the cost of a flight with this company.";NEGATIVE

Who wants to be in an airport all night? Well apparently the ticket agents missed the kindergarten a.m. vs. p.m. lesson.

This past trip I took a board out to my daughter that she built this past summer. It was packed exceptionally well. Wrapped in bubble wrap, covered in cardboard on all surfaces and more bubble wrap on the rails of the board and the whole thing put into a padded surfboard travel bag. Got it to San Diego and the rails were crushed in two places and there was a big heel dent in the bottom on the board. It was like the baggage handlers went out of their way to destroy the surfboard.

So I saw my luggage, picked it up and went to the American Airline desk next to the baggage claim. The girl looked annoyed that I asked her why I got my luggage back if I’m flying again with them the next day. I said that I booked only 1 ticket and didn’t want to carry my luggage back and forth and especially not pay to check it in again. She replied rudely that it wasn’t her problem. I questioned her about what to do to solve my situation. She pointed upstairs and told me to ask someone up there. Without any directions to a certain desk. No “thank you” or any form of politeness. My time was running out to catch my hotel shuttle so I was in a hurry. Upstairs I only saw the regular AA check in counter where there was a huge lineup. Unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to make the line and I had to leave with much unnecessary luggage. It’s ridiculous to have to pay twice for luggage to get to my final destination. If I could have chosen a faster flight to Managua I would have done it to avoid this. The girls attitude was totally unprofessional. I don’t think AA really care about their customer service.

I missed my new connecting flight! They then had to send us ON A BUS to make our new connecting flights, that had been changed 3 times at that point. The bus took us to the connecting airport (Philly), where we had to go back through TSA all over again and wait for a few hours for my flight to Orlando, which was my final destination. I was on vacation for 3.5 days, meeting my family in Disney, and by the time I got there I missed out on an entire days worth of activities/reservations. What a waste of money spent on booking this trip! Not to mention it was a waste of one of my very few vacation days that I was lucky to even get approved through work. I was originally to arrive in Orlando before noon, but I ended up getting there that night. This is not the first issue I've had with American Airlines at the Harrisburg airport. I can't even properly do all areas of this review because I wasn't even on a plane for my one ""flight"", I was on a bus!

american-airlines;2017-12-13; | Flew Charlotte - Frankfurt and return at the beginning of December. We opted to use frequent flyer miles so this was a good value in that respect. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early and the pilots did a good job of alerting us to potential turbulence on the route. The seat back trays were dirty and flight attendants had nothing to clean them with but gave us napkins so we could wipe them ourselves. Seats were okay but no longer have adjustable headrests so not as comfortable as in the past. Cabin crew was what seems to be a typical mix on the legacy carriers - some were pleasant but some were decidedly cranky. Food service was minimal with small portions. Not a big deal for me as I don't tend to eat much on flights but big eaters would definitely be disappointed. Only one beverage service with the meal but drinks (water and juice) were set up in the rear galley so passengers could help themselves. IFE was disappointing. There appeared to be a decent number of options but the touchscreen was very unresponsive and required a lot of effort to move through the menu so I only watched movies and shows from the first page or so. The overall experience was okay and I appreciate the direct flight from North Carolina to Germany but American would not be my first choice for long haul economy as other airlines flying US to Frankfort seem to offer a nice experience.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-12-12;" | The aircraft appeared new, at least on the inside and was very clean. The flight was on time. We were given a pad to spread over the seat for sleeping along with the customary blanket and pillow. The seating is in the 1-2-1 configuration with the same controls and hardware that our Cathay Pacific flight had on the first leg of this trip (Los Angeles - Hong Kong), my wife and I had the two center seats. The business section began with row 4. We had access to Cathay Pacific's Bridge Lounge prior to the flight which was comfortable. It was a night flight (leaving at 7.40pm) so we were served dinner soon after lift-off. The meal was average, with a first course that was inedible (grilled cheese served ice cold and so dry it was difficult to cut or chew). I didn't see anyone eat that course-I wonder if AA gets any feedback on food selections that don't get eaten? The second course, scallops for us, was good enough to eat although nothing to look forward to. The flight crew was spotty in that some were attentive and efficient (in my wife's row) and some were harried, inefficient, and surly (my row). On the whole, the crew was nowhere as good and nice as those in the other airlines we flew this trip, which were all Asian airlines so perhaps it's not a fair comparison. Unfortunately, we had flown Cathay Pacific on the flight over to Asia which is a tough airline to compare to in regards to service although frankly any Asian airline we have flown has better flight crews (more service oriented and nicer) than American Airlines' crews. The Captain was informative as we waited to take off, which was nice. The entertainment options didn't include any recent quality movies although some quality older movies were offered (like ""Casablanca""). The crew didn't bother to ask passengers to open windows when we landed in LAX which made landing a bit less comfortable. All in all we were happily surprised with the seats and aircraft but suffered through the kind of service that is characteristic of AA in our experience. This plane did offer wifi although business passengers had to pay for it ($12 for 2 hours was the shortest plan). It took so long to pull up the wifi plan options I figured the service would be to slow and didn't buy it. Apparently AA sees wifi as an additional revenue opportunity rather than a way to enhance business class and make it more competitive with other airlines. We had flown AA on a similar flight returning from Asia a few years ago and it seemed to us that AA is trying to improve their business class and it is better than it was then. Unfortunately for AA in that market the Asia carriers are often as good as it gets in terms of flight crew service which continues to be AA's weak suit.";POSITIVE

Had seat 1L on the Boeing 787-8. I felt that it was kind of tight and the anchor was attached to seat 2L. Meaning you felt every movement of the other passenger. Although close to the galley for prompt service, kind of bothersome during the flight. Service was excellent. Food presentation and taste not so much. If you like a good cheese platter, you wont find it here, however, the attention to detail of the FA's very good. Plenty of current and classic DVD's to watch.

They didn't ask to see the doctors note or a history of injuries he has had. It is hard for me to believe that after choosing them over every other airlines, they can be so cold to us.

But there were still no plugs, no IFE, just Wi Fi and GoGo movie streaming thru the American app (it actually worked very well, no issues at all and a decent selection of movies). But it makes no sense how they can put power ports on their 18 year old Ex US Air A319s but not a 3 year old Ex US Air A321. Nonetheless the seats were very comfortable with acceptable legroom and service was ok, FAs were average for a US airline, Flight left on time and arrived in San Diego 15 minutes early. Only thing I have to say is other than the red stripe on top of the seats the cabin was very very bland. Literally an all grey interior, grey bulkheads with no logos anywhere, grey and navy blue seats, grey carpet, practically all grey livery. Pretty dismal, also the cost for full Wi-Fi access is obnoxious. I bought a messsaging pass for 2 dollars which claimed it worked on skype but Skype said no internet, I could only use iMessage (no SMS) and I couldn't send pictures which was annoying because when I bought GoGo on US Airways in 2014 I could send and post pictures. AA doesn't like to say these Ex US Airways A321s exist, to know what kind of plane you are on look at the plane type on your reservation when you get your ticket. the Ex US Air A321 will be marked ""321"" the new refurbished one with IFE and plugs is marked ""32B""";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2017-12-04;" |  New York to Los Angeles. American Airlines managed to somehow cancel our tickets that were purchased months previously. The flight was critical for us as we were flying from New York to Los Angeles to connect for our international flight back to Australia later the same day. The first inkling of a potential problem was the day before when I was unable to check in online, so spent hours at an AA office in Manhattan trying to resolve the issue. I was given various explanations but ultimately they accepted no responsibility, asserting that our travel agent in Australia had cancelled or voided the tickets. Again, at the check in counter on the day of the flight, the issue remained unresolved with a supervisor basically saying that our travel agent had ripped us off. We had no alternative but to purchase new tickets (fortunately, I had made a tentative booking the day before in case it was needed, otherwise we would have likely missed our LAX connection considering all flights were full). After returning home, AA repeated their conclusion after investigating the matter that our travel agent had cancelled our tickets which of course they denied so demanded further investigation. Weeks later, American Airlines admitted that the error was theirs all along and offered to reimburse the cost of the new tickets. There was also a gesture of compensation for our inconvenience - a $50 voucher towards another flight on American Airlines - of zero value to us in Australia. Overall, a very disappointing experience given the stress and inconvenience that resulted from their mistake. I would suggest that their staff receive improved training on dealing with such hopefully rare cases - being left in the lurch at a critical time by indifferent staff doesn't leave you with a great impression of an airline.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2017-12-02;" | This was easily the worst flight I've ever been on and it all comes down to the staff. To begin with, I was in a front row, exit row window seat in their 'economy plus' area. Being in an exit row you typically have to attest that you can step up to the plate if there's an emergency and be capable of doing so. The center seat in my row ended up with an extremely morbidly obese woman who was so large she was literally covering part of my body with her own. Her armpit was resting on my shoulder. The staff did not do anything about this situation. This is first and foremost a safety violation, secondly, I did not pay to be the armrest for another human being. This is unacceptable and the airline should have moved her, myself or made other arrangements for someone so large. When the flight attendant came around with dinner, I politely refused. She stood there, literally staring at me, and barked 'How'd I know you'd say that'? Well, I don't know ma'am - do you normally eat when a strangers armpit is grazing your cheek? Perhaps that's why I declined. When we were getting set to land at LHR we were put into a holding pattern. No biggie, this happens some times. However there was no communication from the captain or crew about how long this would be. Approximately a half hour into this wait I asked the flight attendant if she had any idea how long it would be. She stood in front of me, silently removed her scarf, adjusted it, retied it and then rolled her eyes at me and said ""Honey, this happens to every flight, every day at this airport"" - um, excuse me, it doesn't. I've flown into LHR 8 times in the last 10 months on British Airways and not once have we gone into a holding pattern. Not. Once. At any rate, as that didn't answer my question, I repeated my question. She said ""do you have a layover?"" I told her yes, but that it was a 2.5 hour layover so I wasn't concerned about that so much. I didn't want to scream that I was desperate to get out from under the armpit of the person next to me. She literally walked away saying we'd land soon enough. Not to mention, she left a garbage bag at the bulkhead that was kicked over frequently by people lining up for the toilet. She never once picked up the contents - I did - because I didn't want coffee/juice/whatever was in there staining my suede shoes. I literally purchased the in-fight wifi so I could write them a complaint in real-time. I've never been so fuming at an airline in my life! I'll give their wifi 2 stars since my email was successfully sent while still being squashed and poorly treated mid flight. I will never, ever fly American Airlines again! ";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2017-11-28;" | First of all, I would never have flown American Airlines had I had another choice. We fly Alaska Airlines 95% of the time as we have found their customer service superb and we live in the West Coast so it’s most convenient. At this time, however, there is no flight from Philly to Pitt on AK airlines so we booked a second itinerary on American. When we had originally checked in, they would not link our two separate itineraries even though Alaska Airlines did flying down. So we will have to get our bags from baggage claim and drop them, then go through the whole process of checking in our bags/security before our next leg of our long journey home. Apparently, American is undergoing ""budget cuts"" (literally, one of the gate attendants said this) and when you buy a ticket it’s not the same as buying a seat. So you have to pay extra to verify that you A) get a seat and B) get to sit with your party on the plane. Alaska Airlines does not ever make us do this. Again, the woman at the gate had deplorable customer service skills, very rude and curt. Not sympathetic or apologetic at all. She said to ""calm down"" even though I was obviously less than pleased but not acting out in any way. We almost weren’t going to get on our flight because they overbooked — are you surprised? Luckily, two passengers were willing to take a later flight for incentive allowing us to get on the plane. It seems that Americans Airlines is clearly struggling financially and in their professional development of staff. They might as well just close up shop because no one recommends flying on their airline anyway. If I pay $600 RT for a ticket from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh I expect to have a seat and be greeted with a smile. That should not be so much to ask. I have heard Alaska Airlines is adding a leg from Seattle to Pitt. I’ll be glad and happy to pay them for a seat on that flight in the future.";NEGATIVE

Arriving to the airport and waiting at my gate, the time came for boarding and my flight wasn't on the screen. I checked and the gate had been switched.

american-airlines;2017-11-27;" | As always, am never disappointed at being continually disappointed by American Airlines. They have a new policy: they do not check luggage from one of their flights to another of their flights if it is on a separate reservation. If I had booked the tickets on the same passenger name record, it would have cost $2,000 more. American Airlines (along with UAL) seems to revel in seeing how much lower they can plumb the depths of customer service. Although I am platinum elite with this company, on this itinerary they tried twice to collect $25 for a checked bag onto an international flight for a Platinum member (two reasons why the checked luggage is free - want a third? I have an AA credit card). Then they tried to blame Alaska Airlines (a very bizarre attempt to shift responsibility). Delta checks luggage onto Air France and KLM and any other carrier they have a baggage agreement with, and so does UAL (even though I would avoid them because no one wants to be dragged off the airplane and beaten in the gate lobby). AA doesn't even have a ticketing/baggage agreement with AA anymore, so I guess not only are passengers blackballing the company but other airlines as well. In addition, with my platinum status I am supposed to have access to their lounges on international bookings. However, it was refused me this time b/c the connexions were extending past 24 hours even though every connexion was valid and legal. I spoke to a supervisor in the Admirals Club, but it seems AA doesn't empower any of its staff to make logical business decisions in order to serve the public. I was told I could pay $59 for a perquisite that is supposed to be gratis. By the time I made it over to the AA Eagle concourse at LAX, I was then within this 24-hour window and could use the lounge. Like I said, they seem to relish putting their thumbs in the eyes of the public, and I blame the airline companies in America (not in Europe where they are without exception gracious and hospitable to their passengers) for the increase in ""air rage"" incidents by always doing their best to enrage the public with their fees and poor service. This is not a problem in Europe where you are treated as a human being. Not in America - there, you are just a member of a crowd they have to control.";NEGATIVE

Rather than handling the situation before him diplomatically and with grace toward a valued traveler, he replied, ""well, if you really are Platinum Elite then you know you cannot change seats onboard.""

Our seats were in row 13 and the entire overhead compartment above our seat was empty. The pilot came up to us and asked if there was a problem and I said yes they took our bags and said it wouldn’t have fit, there is plenty of room right here.

They ensured me that they had it arranged for the return flight and I also upgraded her seat to give her an exit row seeing she is tall to give her more leg room.

As time flew by and they were trying to figure out we were there three hours early to check in and missed our flight due to them telling us my Father had fraudulent activity in his card. I can’t even explained how embarrassing it was. He called his card he used to pay for the trip right in front of them and the lady told them “ He doesn’t even have a balance, it’s paid off. There is no fraudulent activity on this card. They bounced the ball off the wall a little more then switched from my Father to me saying I had fraudulent activity on my card. Funny thing is my dad payed for the trip not me. I’ve never flown or attempted to fly with American Airlines in my life. They then said that I could fly but I would have to pay in cash for a ticket to Thailand that day which was $6000. We booked our flight and rooms for about $1000 each.  We were not refunded our money. I have tried to contact corporate office several times a day since the incident and still no response. .Before this I had heard a few negative things about American Airlines but not enough to deter me from flying with them.

There were two rounds of drinks and a cookie on these 6-hour flights. the optional food for sale was tasty but expensive. The flights between MIA and MVD (# 989 and 984) were on an old-looking B763 with archaic video screens on the ceiling, small overhead bins, and a mostly friendly and efficient cabin crew, though 1 or 2 of them looked like they didn’t want to be there (on # 984 they didn’t even distribute headphones for the movie or audio service unless passengers requested them) and a male attendant consistently skipped passengers during drink rounds and never acknowledged a “thank you”. The other attendants tried to make up for these slackers. On these 9-hour flights, a small but edible dinner was served 1 hour after departure, followed by a minimal breakfast 1 hour before landing. I suggest bringing a small blanket (all flights were very cold) and a thin pillow (seat padding wasn’t great). Desk and gate agents were friendly and moved things along quickly. Overall, across the four legs of the trip, I had a good experience for a very affordable price, much better than I was expecting from reading many reviews here. I would recommend and fly AA again, trying to avoid their B763 planes. As a side note: I was expecting a more meaningful “preferred boarding” experience for having an AA-associated credit card. On the MIA-SFO flight, by the time I reached my row 9 seat, all overhead space was taken all the way through row 14, so I had to become the dreaded passenger who needs to move down the aisle against the flow of traffic during boarding and deplaning.";POSITIVE

I made the horrible mistake of screwing the time up and arriving at the Denver airport with only 45 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave. When we got to the ticket counter the American Airlines (AA) ticket agent told us that they closed acceptance for luggage 5 minutes ago, so they don't let us on our flight because of 5 minutes! This is where we really got shafted because we asked them to find us another flight to get to Quito and they did, but they gouged us for an extra $2500, which was $1500 more than the original cost of the tickets, we were furious, but with all the other reservations and time taken off work what could we do but let them take advantage of us, so we paid. The ironic rub to that flying out experience was the return flight from Quito, which AA delayed over 3 hours and only gave the excuse that it was ""legal"" issues. When I complained to them in an email they admitted that they didn't plan well enough in this computer age for a flight that had been scheduled for months to be able to have pilots that were rested enough to make that flight according to the FAA, so they held the flight until the pilots were legally rested. So this corporate giant wouldn't hold our outgoing flight 5 minutes so they could load our luggage, but they didn't mind messing up every passengers connecting flights on our return flight because of their own lazy planning.

I'm a licensed aircraft mechanic myself. So I can tell you with absolute certainty that this is part of a daily check by the flight attendants as well as maintenance. They waited until the airplane was fully boarded before someone noticed. This is avoidable if there maintenance department/flight attendants were doing there job. Since I took the delay on this flight it screwed up the rest of my trip. I missed the next connecting flight. Ended up waiting for hours until I was able to depart. Oh wait now I have an extra stop! I get to Philadelphia and this flight takes a 75 minute delay. I've had it with this airline and will be seeking an alternative route or airline in the future. Stay away from these people. They don't deserve to represent the country with that name.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-11-04; |  Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth to Philadelphia. My family and I have never had such poor service until today. The flight attendants were so rude and disrespectful. They were serving other passengers and were talking to all passengers rudely. I asked for my complimentary cookie and they both acted as though we were stealing from them. Then I asked for coffee and she asked the other attendant - 'what does she want' in a ugly manner. Then she slammed the sugar on the tray. I cannot believe attendants are able to treat people this way. If you don't like your job then quit and allow someone else to be happy at what they do.;NEGATIVE

However, Communication of the staff in this airline is terrible. The plane was delayed because of fog but it wasn’t communicated until arrival at a different airport. The inconvenience of this airline cause delayed for a special event I needed to attend. Even when finally arriving at JFK, they said we would arrive in 20 minutes, they been flying more than an hour in circles around the airport. I was very concerned and worry what was going on and no one can tell me why we haven’t landed yet. Recently, I try calling to change the time on my reservation departure time. They was very rude on the phone and can’t seem to help me or even give me a option. I will never travel with America Airlines again.";NEGATIVE

This was another example of a failure to deliver acceptable levels of customer service. The gate staff and cabin crew were disinterested in their job. Customers were really a distraction. Telephoning their call centre is an exercise in patience - I waited for just shy of an hour to speak to someone. When I did they were unable or unwilling to provide the assistance I required. The only good thing I could say about the flight was that my bag arrived. Sadly, American Airlines seems to be struggling on just so many fronts.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-11-02;" | I took American Airlines AA109 flight LHR-LAX (Economy) just over a month ago. And let me tell you, it was nice: you left the plane with a great feeling rather than a standard one! While it is hard to describe what exactly went so well, I will try - the crew: this was probably most important. The crew was very nice and helpful throughout the flight. They brought more water all the time (very important on planes) and was just always there when you needed something. They would also take your trash with them, even when they were just passing by. Some were a little bit stressed toward the end of the flight but that was ok since they were working hard. This was especially obvious after I took my flight back with Iberia from MIA-MAD where it took them a full 2.5 hrs after takeoff to serve drinks for the first time. It was an overnight flight and people wanted to use the time to sleep. I snagged a main cabin extra seat for free using my status, so I had additional legroom, that was great! Also the lavatories were still very clean, even after 11.5 hrs of flight. As we all know, economy class food isn’t especially known for its quality. What we had though, was very good for economy. It was fried chicken in Chinese sweet sauce or something with rice. The sides were fine, as was the breakfast. I was really impressed. (Dinner was also tasty on Iberia but the breakfast was just average I’d say). In the rear part of the plane, the crew had two nice sets of snacks and soft drinks for everyone to have as much as they’d like. They also constantly refilled everything and you could ever ask them for other things they didn’t put out there. Also, they would talk to passengers, it was like a place to socialize! Really amazing for economy. The only thing I didn’t enjoy so much was the temperature. While it was ok for lots of people, I often think it’s a lil bit cold on the planes but the crew assured me, they would turn the heating up a bit for me. Didn’t help so much after all, but that’s ok. As you can see, American Airlines is not as bad as lots of people say. Personally, I enjoyed my time on the plane!";POSITIVE

After 40 minutes at the gate, problem apparently solved and we took off. Fifteen minutes into the flight captain informs that we are returning to DFW as problem still not resolved. Landing complete with fire brigades and ambulances waiting on the side of the runway. On arrival at the gate we are informed flight is now cancelled and we need to disembark. Back at the gate counter, vouchers for hotel and meals are handed out. Assigned hotel, Hyatt, within a 5 minute walk from the gate. Next day the now 10am flight closed the door at 10.30 was already wondering whether we were ever going to leave Dallas after all.

This is the second time in two months in which my flight has been cancelled. Granted this past experience was due to weather, but the rebooking process has been painful and a full day delayed. Good thing I work for a company that is flexible and didn’t need to take a vacation day due to this. The first time it happened, I drove overnight to reach my destination in time - American was useless in even trying to look through other airlines. And when I requested a refund I was told I had to go online and request it. What? I’m on the phone with you after waiting over an hour to speak to a human and you can’t just put something into the computer to apply a refund for a flight I can’t use because of a cancellation outside of my control? Pathetic. This time? Got rebooked for a flight a full day later that was then delayed another 2 hours. Well worth paying an extra $100 to not have to deal with cancellations.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-10-31;" |  Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow in C on a B777-300. Arrived from a domestic flight and transfer in DFW hassle-free, but involved an (easy) change of terminals. DFW is probably one the very best transfer airports in the U.S. AAdmirals Club in DFW was nicer than others I have been to, but offerings very minimal and sub-par for an international flight. Food and ""premium"" drinks for purchase at steep airport prices. Coffee/tea, soft drinks for free. Basic beer and wine available from a manned bar (this is the U.S., so ""free"" means ""for tips""). WIFI was reliable. Overall, definitely not comparable to the lounge experience offered by non U.S.-based airlines. Boarding fairly orderly and cabin crew good and friendly. Seats in C are in a herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. Same seats as CX and these are one of the best seats in C for space and comfort. IFE was AVOD, selection good, Bose headphones supplied, screen not very responsive, but visually good. However, irritating ads before every selection, that could not be skipped or fast forwarded. Dinner (chose the quinoa crusted prawns) was actually tasty on this flight and quality in line what I would expect in transatlantic business class. It was a night flight, so tray service, but service did not feel rushed just to get it over with. Drinks selection good as well and with regular top ups. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was a good choice. Slept thru breakfast, so cannot comment on it, but FA’s offered to bring some coffee just before landing, which was much appreciated. Catering out of AA’s hub in DFW seems to be superior to that out of other locations. Cabin crew professional, obviously experienced and good, even friendly. On-time departure and on time arrival (more or less). Good experience and nothing to complain about. Comparing to other carriers I have used in C over the Atlantic: as for Oneworld alternatives AA is way ahead of BA (especially due to seating arrangement on AA’s B777-300 vs. BA’s high density 2-4-2 seating), probably in line with AY, but not quite on the level of IB. Also, I would rate the overall experience on Star Alliance’s OS and LX higher, but again AA did good on this flight. Recommended, if you are on B777-300 (seating can be much inferior on other planes types).";POSITIVE

The last time I flew with American there flight was late by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because of it and that flight was the last flight out so we were stuck and had to pay an extra $100 for a hotel and I ended up missing my sisters wedding. Then when we landed we were stuck on the flight for 2 hours on the runway. American Airlines is a nightmare.  My time is worth more and I refuse to support a company this horrible";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-10-30;" |  Miami to Albany. I don’t even know where to start with this airline company. I have dealt with issues since booking my flights for my honeymoon. The customer service is horrible! The first issue I dealt with when booking was over the phone. We wanted to switch our flights to a different time so we wouldn’t miss our cruise ship. The flight we had originally booked was cutting it close. Ended up finding another flight (price was less than we paid) when we went to change the flights I had to deal with about 15 different people trying to tell me that I needed to pay more money for switching the flight. After days and numerous people we ended up just booking and paying the extra money. Be careful because if you go On the site and show that you’re looking at a flight the price will raise from when you first looked at it. Next issue was coming home we arrived to the Miami airport. Checking into the flight the day before we got on our boarding passes a certain area to board. When we got to the airport, they changed the gate again and gave us paper boarding passes, then it got close to boarding time and we realized no one was boarding. So I looked on the app and it gave us another area so we rushed there realizing that was also the wrong gate. Our gate for changed 4 different times without being notified. So we ended up Missing our flight. The gate was on the other side of the airport. When talking to the customer service about switching our flight they were very rude telling us that their was nothing they could do and it was our fault that we didn’t know. Never an apology or anything reassurance they were going to help us get home safe. Customer service is horrible with this company. I can’t even believe what I have dealt with. I will never fly American Airlines again.";NEGATIVE

Who doesn’t call in when they will miss a flight (what could he have been doing?)  Then, the gate agent announced that they had found another pilot. This pilot #2 was a passenger on another plane but agreed to fly this plane. We were delayed but did get to Manchester. At least the gate agent was honest enough to say what was going on. I was supposed to fly into Portland, ME but that flight was abruptly cancelled.

Web Check-in worked fine and bag drop at a manned premium counter as I flew F, but in Y everything is do it yourself, except for weighing of the bags. TSA friendly and fast with short lines. SAN seemed to be an easy and well managed airport. No Admirals Club at SAN. Boarding orderly and uneventful. Cabin Crew professional and not necessarily unfriendly, but even in F rather short and devoid of any charm and warmth. No IFE on board, but WIFI was supposedly available for a fee. Lunch served was either a salad with salmon (edible, but not great) or quinoa with vegetables and cheese (cheap choices and definitely not in line with expectations for a flight of 4 hours in F or C). Seats were standard domestic First recliner seats and comfortable enough for a 4 hour daytime flight. Flight departed and arrived on time, which was good. Rather average for a U.S. domestic flight, but below average in most other markets, a painless experience with no particular highlights other than an on-time arrival.

American had another plane fly in to replace broken plane. So our 6:15 departure is now 12:15 then 1:00 then 1:40. We did not pay extra to upgrade our seats so it seems that they will split up seats bought together so you cannot sit next to your spouse apparently that is extra? When our plane arrived we asked if we could change our seat assignment and were told no. Upon boarding we found the plane was half full and those of us who did not pay their extra fees sat in the back rows all split up from our spouses. I realize this is a business and I chose to fly no frills. However, when the company is at fault and they could accommodate a seat change on a delayed flight and place people toward the front to catch their connections why would they not do so? We missed 2 connecting flights because of their poor planning. We have not flown American in years and maybe that was the problem. We will not fly them again. Go Southwest!";NEGATIVE

After much discussion and delay, I finally saw the baggage handlers walk my suitcase over to the stairs of our gangway. Eureka! I saved myself the extra hassle of recovering my luggage after Qatar so skillfully and autonomously managed several potential baggage issues on the other legs of my trip, or so you would think. Even though I was able to intervene enough to get my suitcase to the door of the plane, it actually never made it inside. Whatever happened at that moment saw my luggage delayed until the next flight, 2 hours later. Not impressed by the 'we-don't-really-care-about-you-or-your-luggage' attitude.

Just because it was with another airline, also terrible, I had to pay full, walk-in price for tickets because of American Airlines inability to be on time.

When I was leaving Nashville, I was 33 minutes before boarding time and was still considered ""late"", this lady only let me know the standby option. Clearly the employees are clueless about their jobs and have no sympathy whatsoever. I've never sat in such a tiny seat, I felt absolutely trapped and terrible on only an hour and a half plane ride. When I got on standby the guy at the podium let me know I was the second name to be called. After several names being called, I was the last one along with two other men. They made me walk all the way to the airplane door just to let me know they had miscounted the seats and were fine with sending me away. As I waited for the next standby flight, the lady took forever and continued to do other things while I was sitting right in front of her. Then said the next standby was at another gate, to get in line for 10 mins and wait for them to announce a gate change. I went to the different gate that they announced just for the employees to look at me because they werent ready for that flight yet. The neglect and ignorance of this company is unreal. Not only did I pay $300+ for some stupid flights with layovers just to pay $75 extra because of an undereducated worker. I've never ridden such a terribly serviced plane.";NEGATIVE

I was standing there with 8 other people in Group 9 and the man walks up to us and tells us the gate is closed. They never called last boarding, and never called our group! We were told we were ""late"". We were sent to customer service. As I walked up to customer service, the women closed the rope on me and told me she was off duty and someone else will show up. The Manager arrives and continues to tell me and the 8 other passengers that it was our fault that we were late to the gate and that was why they left without us. Customer service tells me she will place us on standby for the next flight. We get on the bus to the next terminal and race to catch the next flight. When I get there, the person at the desk tells me that I will not be getting on the flight. Customer service sent all of us to another terminal to catch a flight she knew we would never get on!

Throughout the flight they were polite, friendly and attentive. Best of all they had personality and  chatted happily with passengers. The food was nice and just the right amount to be full but not bloated. Inflight entertainment selection was really good. Leg room and seat width were fine for me (average height and build). Just take your own headphones as they only give out ear buds. So overall the Auckland to LA flight was excellent value for money and I'd fly American again to get to the US. I had concerns about my short layover in LA, only 2 hours to clear customs and security and get to the Boston flight. I needn't have worried, LAX do it right. They had an Express Connection pass waiting for all passengers connecting within 2 hours which meant I skipped a lot of queues. They had staff at multiple points to direct passengers, so I made it to my next flight an hour after getting off the first one, and had time to grab a coffee. LA to Boston flight was well organised, left on time, the crew were fine and I'd happily do this flight again too. Again, bring your own headphones.

So I went up there and asked them to arrange the seats so each parent could sit with a kid but they said the flight was full and they could not change seats. I told them my departure flight was the same way and they were able to change my seats but the person refused to do so. So I got mad and just left and let it be. I am writing to complain about American Airlines staff at LAX airport and their very unreasonable accommodation for family and kids traveling abroad. DFW seems to accommodate just fine but LAX is not so accommodating. This is just my experience and not representing all passengers. Hopefully they will read this and change their policies.";NEGATIVE

What an awful and disappointing business class experience. Lounge at JFK was overcrowded, food abysmal and staff the rudest I have encountered. Hoping that things would improve on the flight, how wrong I was! Seats were worn and quite dirty, service was abrupt and lacking anything of note. Food is served in large portions, but was very bland and the service was so slow. IFE is okay and didn't watch much anyway. BA has gotten a lot worse in recent times, but even they exceed these terrible American Airlines standards.";NEGATIVE

After pulling away from the gate and suffering in this sauna plane for 3 hours they announced that it wouldn’t be fair to make us sit in the hot airplane for the flight. We were told we would have to return to the gate, which took another 45 minutes. The entire flight would have taken 1.5 hours, we spent more than twice that time on the hot airplane! Their reasoning for not taking off was that they didn’t want us to be uncomfortable! We are deplaning now, this story is not yet over. Also, this plane is brand new, but the only update seems to be that they took away more space from each individual passenger. Literally forced to lean forward in this seat";NEGATIVE

When I ask the attendant at the adjacent gate (because their is no attendant at our gate) what is happening she looks it up and says the time was pushed back to 10:35pm. No apologies, no compensation, no regard for the fact that my 83 year old grandmother is stuck waiting at the airport in Phoenix to pick us up. So I'm completely sleep deprived and she is afraid to drive after dark and now I get to drive the hour and a half home from the airport at midnight after traveling over 30 hours without sleep. Their terminals don't even have seats without armrests to stretch out on and try and grab a cat nap. The lack of compassion and customer service from America Airlines is shocking and disappointing to say the least. I will check reviews prior to booking my next flight. Cathy Pacific took excellent care of my family and I from South Korea to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong to LAX., but the customer service went out the window when we transferred into American Airlines hands. I do not recommend anyone fly American Airlines in the future. You're just a ticket number not a customer or consumer to them.";NEGATIVE

Most absurd thing I ever heard. Southwest does not do this. Will never give American Airlines another chance. Also purchased, what I thought was their trip cancellation insurance at the time of booking on their site only to find out this is a separate company and basically this coverage only covers specific situations.

The person at the check desk said that I need to check both busters and get them back at the baggage claim. I explained to her three times I did not wanted to check those items and retrieve them at the baggage claim. She printed out and put the papers on the busters without me agreeing to it. The other person working at the gate realized what was going on and stepped in and helped the situation. She printed out the correct tags and we were able to check the two busters at the gate and retrieve them as we walked out of the airplane. The first worker did not even apologized for her lack of customer service. Shame on this person and the airline who hires incapable people!;NEGATIVE

The tickets are much more expensive than their competitors (Southwest, etc) and there is less room for seating and less room for carry-ons to be stowed above. The overhead storage space is so limited that I had to check a carry-on I brought, which may cause fragile items to be damaged. When asked about why I would have to check this, the female attendant spoke with an extremely annoyed and sarcastic tone telling me “well that’s too bad, you can take a seat and book another flight”. This is awful practice, and is a mystery to me why a person like this is getting paid to represent a company. I will never fly with American Airlines again, and I suggest anyone considering flying with them abandon that idea. Also, boarding began after the scheduled time as well as take-off.";NEGATIVE

American’s online boarding pass links did not work, so I had to get agents to print them at my layover city. My flight home was cancelled and no voucher was offered.

Had they been honest from the jump I could have made other arrangements. Airline ticket is a contract allowing 2 carry on bags, which AA are now claiming isn't the case on this aircraft though the fine print neglects to mention that. They demanded I part with valuables and check bag to fly. (Literally just got off AA flight that allowed it- standard size carry on). The flight attended looked me in the eye and point blank lied at 9:45, claiming the flight was leaving at 10. ";NEGATIVE

Our plane in August to St. Thomas looked straight out of 1970 with no in flight entertainment. Still even has ashtrays. How is that for a 4 hour flight? We paid way too much for that type of service! Unfortunately where we live and want to fly to, we have 2 choices which are AA and Delta. From now on, we will try and take Delta. Our last 3 experiences with AA have been lackluster. We were bumped from our return flight we made 7 months in advance with little compensation. They put us up at a hotel and gave us each $20 for dinner, breakfast, and lunch. Breakfast alone was $23 per person plus tax for a buffet so you can imagine how much lunch and dinner was. The hotel AA put us in said AA overbooks and bumps people often! Not to mention the extra money we had to pay for pet sitters and time missed from work coming back over 24 hours late. They made very little apologies. After emailing back and forth, I finally got $200 flight vouchers. But it didn’t come easy. Plus we have to go through Charlotte, NC for connecting flights which is the rudest airport I have ever been in.";NEGATIVE

No more AA flying for me.";NEGATIVE

I’ve had one bad experience after another with American Airlines. I arrive to gate T9 around 5am and immediately go to the check in desk because I’m flying Basic Economy for the first time so I want the gate agents to know that I’m here and would like a seat number for the flight. One rudely responds, “We’ll call your name when we’re ready for that.” I sit down patiently waiting for my name. Finally my name is called, and she asks me if my small duffel bag is the only bag I have? I respond that yes it is. Another agent chimes in that it looks like it it is too big and that I will have to pay for it. I respond that it should fit under my seat, so I put it in the demonstration bin and of course it fits. They tell me they just wanted to see my bags and that I can sit back down and wait for the next instruction. When it comes time for boarding group 9 to board, I wait for my name to be called. (now apparently there are two individuals with my last name, and the other individual is flying standby. But I don’t find this out until later.) they ask the group to walk with them down the runway and wait for a seat number. I ask the agent when I can board since I paid for a ticket, she asks the other agent about me who checks her list and says that “You’re not on my list!” They give up all seats on the flight and I have now missed my flight. We get back to the desk at which point I’ve never had two grown women be so disrespectful to me. They both blamed me for not getting on the flight. Saying the flight had two Individuals with my last name but not once did they call a first name. I now know that neither Individual with my last name made the flight.

So I'm late for work, I'm out hundreds of dollars, I do not have my luggage and I am beyond upset! I call and they issue a refund of $96.72. What the heck did that cover! Every time I fly American there are issues. Save yourself time and money and fly with anyone else! Also I paid for the wifi service during the flight and I should have known - it didn't work either.

The aircraft broke down and needed to be replaced. The flight was the best part of 5 hours late. Inflight service and ground handling was ordinary. Once upon a time America lead the world with customer service. American Airlines staff seemed to be so demotivated that they really have little interest in their customers. The whole lack of a service culture seems to filter through the airline. They just don't care. This happens far too often and they risk long term customers like me moving their business elsewhere.;NEGATIVE

Once we got to the plane a worker asked the people in front of us their seats and let them on. Once we approached she never asked us our seats And very nasty told us ""y'all can't board you have to wait"". I said to her the other worker said we could we're seated in row 4. Her face turned red and she said ""oh ok come on board"" the reason for the hold up was because they were boarding a disabled passenger in the main cabin not first class.

Whenever I called, it keep disconnecting me or they pretend on the other side that they can't hear me, and disconnect. I called AA and they were unable to help me, because the reservation was made through FlightHub agency, so FlightHub is who I need to go through. I called FlightHub again, and after 3 weeks I was finally able to connect with them. They kept me on the phone for 3 hours, going back and forth with American Airlines - finally AA announced that my ticket is not eligible for refund! It is close to $500 that they are refusing to refund and I would understand if the circumstances were different, but the cancellation due to natural disaster should be refunded no matter what.

Once we finally got off the plane I had 10 minutes to get to my next flight so the stewardess directed me to an AA desk to get another flight. The desk of 3 American Airlines worker had no one at their gate or desk so the stewardess left me their for the 3 girls to help me. The 3 workers never looked up from their desk, and when I finally got them to acknowledge me they said they couldn’t help me because they were busy preparing for an international flight that left in 5 hours! I asked them to at least see if my flight had done last call. They refused saying “we don’t have all the time in the world to help people that aren’t on this flight”. Again, that flight didn’t leave for 5 hours and there were 3 workers! I finally made it down to my gate and spoke with customer assistance. The 3 workers there were all on their cell phones, which they didn’t put down when I arrived for help. I explain the situation and also told them I was shocked by the lack of customer service I received at the other desk. 2 of the workers giggles and rolled their eyes while on their cell phones. The gentleman helping respond, “there are more customer that missed their flight than just you, those workers have to managed many customer with specific need, this desk has all the time in the world though. I have you on a new flight, have a nice day”. I’m happy the gentleman was more “welcoming” than the other 5 customer service workers but I can honestly say this is the worst airline customer service I have experienced from any airline company.

No private screen (which is standard for British, United, Lufthansa, Swiss), no way to control the air conditioning (it was freezing cold), the audio from the audio jack was not working well and the seat pocket was a little broken. On the way back, the cabin crew, and particularly one flight attendant, was just so rude I could not believe my ears. I was asked if I wanted to change seats because I was seated close to the restrooms in the back and when I politely declined explaining that I wasn’t feeling very well and wanted to stay close to the restroom I got a ""yeah, whatever!"" as a response while she walked away.

Check in staff were very very slow. Not sure what the problem was but it took an hour for me to reach the front of a 10 person queue with 3 counters open.

Instead of appreciating our business and apologising for the inconvinience of being delayed (once again, this is my 17th delayed flight in the last few months) the employees got defensive, rude and disruptive.

american-airlines;2017-09-16;" |  Seattle to Quito via Dallas. For about a year, we planned a trip to the Galapagos and Machu Picchu, and bought round trip airline tickets on American Airlines. The night before our flight (flight departing morning of 8/5/17), we printed boarding passes. At approximately 10PM we received a non-urgent email from American stating: please call to rebook your flight. No other info given. We almost overlooked the email because of the lack of urgency and the fact that we already had our boarding passes. When we called we were informed our entire trip to Equador was cancelled due to ground conditions. I called both airports we would be landing at and they reported no delays or ground conditions. American Airlines would not tell us what the ground conditions were. The night they cancelled, American Airlines only offered to move us to a flight on American leaving 48 hours later which would not get us to our destination for 4 days. (Our original flight would get us there in just over 24 hours.) They would not put us on a flight with another airline, which were available. They did not apologize and treated us like we were wasting there time. We were told we would not be given any compensation for the loss of 4 days of our trip. I called other airlines myself, in the middle of the night, and booked us on Delta (for flights that would get us to our destination on time,) but had to pay $4500 out of pocket. Delta got us to our destination on time and with no ground condition delays. We landed at the same time our original flight was scheduled to land. Upon return from our trip, we tried to contact customer relations at American to get a refund. There was no phone number, so we wrote an email and waited for a call. A day later, a representative notified us we would be getting no compensation for our losses. She gave a cursory ""I apologize for your inconvenience"" She gave us no further support and would not transfer us to a superior.

There are no phone numbers for customer service, refunds, or managers. Approximately 1 month after our cancelled flight, we finally received a refund of $1680 for the cost of the flight that was cancelled, but we were not compensated for the $4500 we lost. We felt that each person we talked to was unhelpful and even rude at times. We understand that flights can get cancelled but expect to be helped onto another flight in a timely manner or compensated for our losses. At the very least we should have an explanation of why our trip was cancelled. American did none of these and we will never fly with them again";NEGATIVE

A woman then made a smart comment about using the qiosk to check in our bags. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the qiosks are meant for busy times. There were enough staff members to help those who were in line but they appeared to be too busy to do their job.

I called the airline to see if they can get me on another flight as I needed to get home. They had plenty of flights going out of Aruba the following two days but insisted on getting me on a flight that was 5 days later. The agent I spoke to was not helpful what so ever. I explained to her that the other airlines were still operating and asked if they could take care of my ticket with another airline, that was denied. At one point the supervisor got on the line and said to me ""I am not sure why you are wasting your time talking to us when you could be booking a ticket with another airline."" If all flights were cancelled I would have understood, but only mine was. Which really frustrated me, if you cannot fly into that specific airport, reroute the flight and fly into one that you can. Simple. The supervisor got very rude and asked me if I had the ability to make the airplane magically appear. I mean I could go on forever about the awful customer service I received from American Airlines. ";NEGATIVE

The only flight which is available in AA is next day morning. They said they will arrange accommodation. But they have given a single room for all 3 of us. When i checked with manager to give separate rooms, he said it will be provided in the hotel. But when we reached there it was only 1 single double room and of us had to sleep on the floor. This is the very worst case I have ever seen with the airlines. They should consider the priorities before taking decisions. I would suggest not to take this airline. ";NEGATIVE

I spent 17 hours at different airports all do to with American Airlines problems. Starting my flights in Salisbury, MD. Supposed to have a connection in Charlotte, then on to Fort Lauderdale. The first flight being overbooked. Thinking I was helping out the airline, I accepted a 300 dollar voucher and rebooked on a flight that should have gotten me into Fort Lauderdale earlier than my original flight. Now the fun starts, arriving at the first airport at 5am and finally getting to my destination 17 hours later. The first flight of the day was overbooked. The 2nd flight was delayed due to mechanical problems causing me to miss my connection because of the delayed flight. Since I missed my connection American Airlines tried to find another flight for me, the next flight they offered was almost 10 hours hanging out in the Philadelphia airport before taking off. Then they found a different flight leaving about 3 hours later with another connection in Charlotte. When we arrived in Charlotte, the American Airlines gate area was a total mad house. People standing everywhere up against each other and people sitting on the floor, because of American Airlines problems. It felt like there was no air conditioning, because of all the people in a small area. They were all talking on the microphones at the same time, mentioning delays and offering 900 dollars or more for giving up flights. Now the connecting flight in Charlotte then was delayed several times. Because of all the problems with American Airlines, I missed a lunch and dinner. Also a friend had to rent a 2nd car, because I was the one with the car rental for the trip. Once I got home a few days later I contacted American Airlines and explained the situation, and to let them know I was not pleased. Of course I get a company generated form letter, not even mentioning my complaint, just stating policies. This company could care less about their customers and how they treat them. Being such a large company, they should be more concerned about customer relations.

I was at SFO for 16 hours I had to pay $75 to grab another flight even though I paid $950 for 2 one-way flights just 24 hours prior. American customer service team members were the worst, they must train them to have a blank face and not care at all. The counter reps in SFO all could care less about helping at all.

Then they went on and on and kept on delaying the expected departure time. And after 2 whole hours of sitting on the plane, they told us we would have to go outside in the boarding area and wait. At this point I was a little annoyed, but not mad. After that, they made us wait 3 more hours outside in the boarding area, with little to no help from the staff on when we were going to leave, before they told us the whole flight had been cancelled. I was going to miss a whole day of seminars that I had to attend. Then I was like its okay, mistakes happen, and then rebooked the flight for the next morning at 6AM since they had no more available flights on that day.  I got back home at around 2, so I had been there for about 8 hours.  The next day I was on my way to the airport when I got a text message that my 6AM flight had been cancelled too. At this point I was furious. It was not even a weather related issue, it was because of American Airline's lack of preperation ahead of a flight, in which they always seem to have problems with their system. I had to call their customer service an try to rebook, since I had to get to Philly as soon as I could. The staff on the phone were horrible, first they said there were no more flights availble on that day to philly, (In which there were because I could literally see that there were available flights - I was looking at it on my phone when I was talking to them). Then I asked them if they could switch me to another airline, in which they said that it was not possible. I hung up the call out of frustration, and called them back a few minutes later, this time someone else picked up. I asked him the same question I asked the other guy, that if they could switch me to another airline. This time, the answer was different. He said he could switch me over to united. I was shocked, because the other guy told me they could not do that. The united flight was later in that day, so by then the program I was going to attend in Philly would be over, so I decided to ask for a refund. I had to scream at the guy to let me get a refund because he was refusing to give it to me for ""privacy"" purposes, which didn't make sense at all. Even after all that I went through, I could not understand how someone could not give someone their money back. After about an hour of yelling and convincing, he finally gave me a refund.

He asked the question in a very rude manner and looked visibly annoyed that I was asking him something. I would have expected something along the lines of: ""I'm sorry mam, I did not hear you."" In any case, I repeated my question. Me: Can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff: Well we're about to take off so I can't. I did not catch the rest of his answer because as he started responding he simply turned around and continued talking as if he wasn't talking to me - all this in a very rude and angry tone. I thought to myself I'm only asking for a glass of water and if indeed it is not possible now, the correct and polite answer would have been: ""I'm sorry mam, but unfortunately we are about to take off so it is not possible right now. We'll bring you a glass after take off."" For someone who travels quite a lot with major airlines and have platinum level with some airline mileage programmes, I was quite shocked because this is really the lowest in terms of the quality of in-flight personnel.

A representative responded to my inquiry and informed me that there is nothing they can do. I repeatedly inquired to escalate this issue to the supervisor.

American Airlines deliberately delayed our flight in order to accommodate a connecting flight coming from another state so they only had to provide one trip but thereby inconveniencing all travelers they willing delayed which ruined our first day of our vacation and honeymoon. The airline was not forthright about its decision and we were given two different reasons which both proved to be untrue. I attempted to contact AA directly and was basically told in several email responses that we eventually got you there so get over it! I will never fly AA again and warn all who consider using them to do your research and look for better options. Not user friendly at all.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-08-15;" |  What a terrible experience on American Airlines. First we have a 4 hour delay in Charleston, because apparently the air conditioning on the plane wasn't working. Then after 2 hours trying to fix it they finally assign another plane to come pick us up in Charleston from Charlotte, NC. This delay causes us to miss our connecting flight and bumps our departure to tomorrow morning (or so we thought). Upon arrival in Charlotte, we find out that our flight to Des Moines was delayed too allowing us to make the flight however it was too late, they sold our seats and we couldn't get on the flight despite being on that flight to begin with. This experience caused me to miss a critical business meeting. I've had nothing but poor experiences with American and it's frustrating to yet again be stuck in a connecting city when it turns out I was on time for the flight anyhow. Thanks for selling the seat that was mine and bumping me to the following day. Come to find out while mingling with a frequent traveler departing Charleston, this is a regular occurrence and this plane frequently has mechanical delays. Take the time to service your equipment. We all have families to get home to, busienss to tend to and we all pay a pretty penny to fly with you. It's clear my money is better spent with a competing airline.";NEGATIVE

The plane was old, the toilet was not kept clean during the flight. The female flight attendant sat strapped in and facing us mid-flight and ate, after which we were given nothing. We arrived at 5:55am without being offered juice or coffee prior to landing. We were to be given ""snacks"" plural but got only one snack serving at the start of the flight and nothing during the rest of the time. We had no brewed coffee available. The flight attendants' uniforms looked as though they had slept in when we boarded the plane. This was the most class-less First Class. The air quality was also poor. There was a strange smell when we got on, and it did not dissipate. You could choose to close air vents or endure cold air blasting down on your head. The equipment should be replaced and so should the crew. The seats are hard and barely recline.  We were on time and had a safe flight. That's all that matters in the end, but choice of airlines is competitive.";NEGATIVE

There are so many components that go into air travel that it becomes trite to focus on event that left a bad taste. So, this review is to extol American Airlines. Checking in at SFO was quick and easy and the women who placed the luggage on the belt was charming. The Admirals Club was staffed by friendly workers and the morning display of food was more than enough to satisfy even a picky traveler. The Aircraft is amazing as is the business class seats. The FAs were professional, warm, friendly, and proud to be serving the customer. The food was as good as the service. IFE was outstanding. This was one of the best flights I have taken. American is doing what they do best. Perhaps it is the route that warrants this service. ";POSITIVE

american-airlines;2017-08-11;" |  Los Angeles to Shanghai PVG. I just encountered the absolute worst check-in and security I have ever experienced. We were at the American Airlines terminal at LAX. They insisted we checked in using machines, none of which worked for us.  When we went to a desk the lady behind the encounter was rude and accused us of using the machines incorrectly.  We were given seats not next to each other for our 13.5 hour flight. When we asked if we could sit next to each other the woman told us it didn't matter we'd just have to ask people to swap with us or we would have to pay a minimum of $150 per person to change seats to be together.  We went to complain and got sent to the priority check in desk. When we explained the situation, the person behind this desk said aggressively that the seats must all be sold out except the extra leg room seats. When I said the other person hadn't said these seats were extra leg room, just that we had to pay to sit together, she told me I must have heard her wrong or misunderstood her. The priority desk person then threw our passports and boarding passes on the counter and said aggressively ""you're all set"", when I asked ""what do you mean"" she rose her voice and said ""I put you guys together!"" and gave a shooing motion towards us with her hand. No apologies, no explanations. We the continued to the American Airlines security area, put our things in boxes and queued up to go through. A security person, again aggressively shouted at people saying ""you have to stay with your boxes"", so my boyfriend and I stayed in the queue to go through next to our boxes about a foot away. The same person then came very close to my face and said ""Miss is that your box?"" To which I responded ""yes"". He then said condescendingly ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" I didn't understand the question because in every other airport you put your box in the row and staff make sure it goes through the machine for you. So I looked at him confused at which point he aggressively pointed at the box and me and shouted ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" At which point I felt really intimidated and said ""I am?"" Then he said ""exactly. Then get over there."" I felt humiliated.  So I got on the queue and walked in to the body scanner when called, stood on the yellow feet on the floor then the next security person again with horrible attitude said ""did you got through pre-security?"" I looked back saw there was nothing else behind me but the area I had just been shouted at in and said ""yes."" He then said sarcastically ""you look like you're wearing sandals"". Clearly I was. So I said ""yes"". He then said in an accusatory, rude voice ""you were supposed to take them off and put them through the x-ray scanner"" and gave me a shooing motion so I returned to the x-ray scanner, put my shoes in a box and got back in the queue. Just to clarify there were no signs or messages saying you needed to push your boxes or take off your sandals. The whole experience left me feeling awful. There are plenty of far better, cheap airline carriers out there. ";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2017-08-09;" |  New York JFK to Manchester. American Airlines is probably the worst airline I've ever flown with. After boarding we were kept waiting on the group for around 1h50 mins with very little explanation of why. I was sat at the rear of the aircraft and as there is no closed off area for staff they were pretty much just sat around chatting loudly (which is fine, but on most aircraft they have a closed off area and can do it without everyone having to listen). This aircraft had no seat back TVs so we had nothing to do. After take off we were given a very poor dinner, although there was a good selection of drinks. The experience so far was generally poor, but mildly acceptable considering it's a budget airline. However the last 2 hours of the flight were awful. Suddenly the smoke alarms began to sound and the staff very casually checked the aircraft for signs of danger (this was only looking in bathrooms and touching walls for signs of heat) for about 10 minutes. The alarms sounded for the remainder of the flight with no announcement or instructions to reassure passengers. Awful, avoid American Airlines.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-08-08;" | Me and my family managed to grab a bargain with American Airlines on our most recent vacation from Glasgow to Orlando via Philadelphia. The price was more than 70% cheaper than any other airline operating the route, however if I knew the misery we would have to endure then I definitely wouldn't have flown with AA. The first problem arose at check in (GLA-PHL) where we were allocated new seats from the ones we had previously purchased resulting in my family being split up throughout the aircraft. We complained and was given new seats nearby each other but still not the ones we had paid £200 for previously, which American Airlines are still refusing to issue a refund. Next when we arrived at the gate we were informed that the flight was delayed but that it wouldn't be long and they were going to commence boarding - not long turned into sitting on the aircraft for almost 2 hours. The aircraft was old, in need of refurbishing, extremely cramped and didn't have personal inflight entertainment which American Airlines didn't tell us while booking. The aircraft did have an overhead screen which played one movie during the 7hrs 45min flight to Philadelphia, however me, and many other people sitting around us thought it was unsuitable for children to view. The staff were rude, never came across people with such bad manners, talked inappropriately about passengers onboard the aircraft (which we have complained about) and couldn't be bothered doing their job but instead stand at the back of the aircraft talking. The food was poor quality, even for airplane food, and was thrown down in front of us. The aircraft landed just over 2 hours late making it tight for our connection to Orlando. Once on the connecting flight we were told that our bags had missed the connection and would be sent on the next flight out, not the best news for the start of you're holiday. We had a mad dash to the flight, just making it by minutes to spare, and once we sat down were told that the flight was delayed due to technical problems resulting in another 2 hour delay. The staff were slightly friendlier on the connection to Orlando and we eventually landed about 5 hours late (thunderstorms near Orlando delayed us). We got off the aircraft rather quickly and proceeded to baggage information for American Airlines which told us that our bags wouldn't be arriving until the next afternoon, we were offered several thousand air miles as compensation which we rejected as we had already decided we will never touch American Airlines again. Our bags eventually arrived the next evening but an extremely poor service and lack of information from American Airlines. I definitely do not recommend.";NEGATIVE

I do not appreciate PHL gate staff barking orders at passengers and not using the PA system prior to a 9 and a half hour long-haul flight. Upon boarding, a passenger opened a box of very smelly food and proceeded to eat it during push back - flight attendants did nothing to intervene. The quantity of diner food items was very stingy for such a long flight, and I would have been starving if I did not bring my own food. Flight attendant servicing my row was also stingy with the complimentary wine - would not offer a refill until dinner service was completed.

We checked four bags/items ($75 b/c the stroller was free) at the urging of the gate attendant at check-in because they advised the flight would be full and there would be little room in the overhead compartments. Upon arriving in Newark, we picked up two bags and the stroller but the other piece of luggage was nowhere to be found. The surly woman in the baggage claim area of American Airlines (AA) said that the bag was put on the wrong flight but that it would arrive later in the evening and be delivered within 24 hours. I then took the day off work ... but the bag never arrived. Several phone calls later, what we know is that they can't find our bag and that they really aren't particularly concerned about it. Almost every representative that we've spoken with in the baggage handling customer service department has been less helpful than the one before. They cannot locate the bag and they're ""not sure what else to tell us at this point"" (that's a quote). Meanwhile, I'm out an expensive Rimowa bag and several thousand dollars in clothing and other items. Some of them with sentimental value and which can never be replaced. Any effort at replacing our items will be a tedious and time consuming process and I'm sure will be laden with red tape and bureaucratic obstacles. And they won't even begin that process for 5 days. Even though they admit that they can't locate the bag and it's coming up on 48 hours here shortly. American Airlines is a joke, they lose your luggage and basically laugh at you when you seek assistance. Two days later and they have no idea where our checked bag is now? This has to be the worst and least helpful customer service. The poorly trained customer service reps at AA are flippant, unhelpful, and totally unsympathetic to one's plight. The fact that this airline carries the name ""American"" in the company's moniker is a disgrace. If you value your personal belongings and don't appreciate being treated like yesterday's used up garbage, do yourself a favor and either find another airline to fly or just stay home.";NEGATIVE

My biggest complaint is when I was dropped off by a tour company at Las Vegas (after a 14 days trip) for my return trip home 6+ hours before the flight boarded American refused to check my bags. They said their policy was not to accept baggage until four hours before a flight. Effectively I was being asked to sit in the main departure lobby for 3.5 hours to check luggage. This was unacceptable. After I complained to a self-check attendant she finally agreed to issue boarding passes and said we could gate check one piece of luggage each complimentary. I had been unable to check in electronically due to the tour and spotty internet access. We carried four pieces of luggage, one carry-on each and one piece each we intended to check, to Gate D which is a really long hike. We did this and were accommodated but had to sit with the luggage all evening and take it with us when we went to eat. None of this made sense. Why would American risk making a customer angry and forego $50 ($25 each checked bag x 2) in revenue by refusing to check bags on arrival and forcing gate check? We were tired, hungry, facing a red-eye flight and just wanted to be shed of the baggage. Now let's backtrack to our departure from Greenville-Spartanburg. The flight crew did not show up on time. The captain and first flight attendant showed up for the flight at 7:50 for an 8:05 flight. The other attendant/s and co-captain showed up at 8 sharp. Needless to say we left late. Our connection through DFW was not pleasant. When our flight landed we sat on the tarmac for over 30 minutes waiting for a gate. We were told we would taxi to three different gates before the plane actually moved to the original one. We barely made our connection with time for a restroom break. When we departed Las Vegas McCarran to return home the rest rooms at Gate D used by American were filthy. A janitorial staff member was present but did not appear to be doing much. Many urinals in the men's room were cordoned off and out of service.

american-airlines;2017-07-18; |  Eight flights in last ten days with American. All OK basic average. Then arrived in San Diego missing one very important bag. American staff at the baggage handling area were neither good or bad and they advised me the bag would arrive next morning at 10:30. American Airlines employ a contractor or perhaps it's two contractors to handle late baggage delivery. My experience of this is that information available on whereabouts of your bag/s is very hard to obtain. The information on the delivery contractor/s website is wrong and not updated. Call handling by American Airlines is utterly appalling and amateurish. Call handling agents do not have required information easily to hand and that indicates American Airlines have a garbage infrastructure. After several phone calls one AA call handler kindly let me know the name of the delivery contractor and I was able to finally find out where my bag was and coordinate delivery directly with the contractor. I am shocked and a bit angry to note just how useless AA have been in fixing this not uncommon problem. ;NEGATIVE

I feel I was forced to purchase premium seats ($185) because there was no available regular seats available to choose from to guarantee me a seat.  I would have chosen any regular seat to try to keep my cost as low as possible. When I contacted the airline they informed me that I would have been assigned one of those premium seats for free if I would not have already paid for it.  I'm sorry but I do not want to take a chance of getting bumped from a flight because I did not have an assigned seat.;NEGATIVE

Then the one employee checking coach class customers helped 2 other customers while we felt like fools for paying first class prices. All was well and the 1st class cabin was comparable to competitors. Food was a disgrace. Service was good. White wine was served warm with no apologies. On our return again ignored while standing in priority check in while watching coach class customers jump ahead. Again food was a disgrace. This time the stewardess did say the white wine was not yet cold. And gave us the option of warm or waiting a while for it to chill. While waiting to board in DFW we ask if there would be a meal served. Trying to decide if we needed to purchase and carry on something for lunch. To our surprise neither of the 2 AA employees knew and had no idea how to find out. I guess my biggest problem is that first class prices should be supported with first class service and food. Our expectations are based on Delta's 1st class service. Pre flight video wasted no time bragging about being the largest airline with 6700 planes. And yes that's impressive, But please note, I can only fly in one plane at a time and really expect that flight to compare to the airlines with less than 6700 planes.

My latest experience not only included a delay, a cancellation, and then a flight change to one full day later, it also included a 3 hour cluster-you-know-what of uncertainty as to where our baggage was. The ticket tracing system was completely usesless and when I attempted to speak to one of their robotic customer service reps, I was told that there was nothing that could be done and that my bags would be available the next day in Chicago. (We were trapped in Charlotte for the night). The issue is that at the time of flight change to make up for the cancellation, we were guaranteed by an AA rep that our baggage would be released upon arrival in Charollette. When trying to explain this to the baggage service rep, I was told I was wrong, and that nobody could go get the bag for over 5 hours. There are many more details surrounding the disrespectful way that the baggage claim rep handled the situation but my qualm is with the rip-off that is AA as an organization"".";NEGATIVE

We sat strapped listening to regular updates from the cockpit. The plane was clean. the toilet ran out of tissue paper and a flight attendant had to be told. Soon after takeoff a packet of salted pretzel was given out to the passengers but no drinks leaving my mouth totally dry. Dinner was served soon after with complimentary wine and beer. I chose a pasta dish. The small tray was overloaded with smallish portions from all the food groups - salad, bread, entree, dessert. A hot snack was provided before landing. A large selection of films on the personal IFE but the free headphone provided was so poor in quality that I did not watch or listen to anything as the sound was inaudible over the roar of the engines. Advice: bring your own headphones. The seat was not comfortable at all. The padding and cushioning was rather thin. Worse was the tapping you felt on your back whenever the passenger behind pressed buttons on her IFE to select items for viewing - so thin was the cushioning. Not to mention the lack of any lumbar support. Flight attendants were dutiful and appeared when needed. Overall, another unmemorable flight and totally unimpressed with premium economy.";NEGATIVE

There is no seat-back IFE just the large monitors placed throughout the cabin. Didn't watch the movie because the sound was not very good. I had my tablet with me so I just watched a couple of downloaded movies on the 6 hour flight. Flight attendants came through the cabin a couple of times with drinks and selling snacks. One of the attendants was cranky but the others were very pleasant. Seat was worn and could use an upgrade. The flight was generally comfortable, we left on time and arrived on time and our bags were out about 20 minutes after we landed. Overall a reasonably good flight.

Which was pretty good, since I used it with different airlines. Now things changes and you get regular boarding, they just put you ahead in group number 5, but customer service at the gate of JFK was so terrible that you literally have to fight to get on board with your group since all people lined up and in rush. Another thing they forcing people to check carry on. Old planes. On the way back from Vegas even worse.

I asked if they could place me in a hotel for the night as I live far from Grand Rapids, so on top of arriving late I will have to drive for a while as well. They looked at me like I was crazy. Not to mention the money I've had to spend on food while waiting because I planned to be home.

The flight in Chicago did not board until 25 minutes after scheduled.

Arrived in CLT and deboarded at 10:12 PM at terminal B16, connecting flight doors close at E24, 10:20 PM. Needless to say, missed flight. American Airline customer service unapologetically offered a hotel and a 9:30 AM flight the next day as only option. Problem - had appointment that I could not miss at 9.30 AM in Augusta. I pushed it - wanted a rental, AA agent got a bit nasty. No rentals available, took car service back (probably cheaper than a 1 way rental in the end). Still arguing with AA - they claim total liability is $90 - the land mile % of total trip that was unused. They blame wind, weather, airport flight controllers and ""me"".

Our first flight was delayed because of one single passenger's passport not going through. A flight full of about 60-70 people delayed 45 minutes for one individual - which should have been figured out by removing her from the flight, as there were many people (at least 25) whom had connecting flights they had to get to, including us. We had a connecting flight in Chicago that was leaving 30 minutes after we landed, prior to the delay time. We were instructed to call the delay hotline to find flights for our party of 8 from Chicago to Minneapolis, in case we did not make it in time to catch our connection. We arrived with about 10 minutes to spare because of a delay in the mechanics with said connecting flight. We got to the gate to assure we were going to make it and it turns out the hotline screwed up 3 of our seats and booked us for a flight leaving 5 hours later than our original take off time that we sprinted through O'Hare airport to make. While I understand screw ups, the attitudes of the ladies at the gate was absolutely unacceptable. Not once did we receive an apology, nor did they seem willing to help, even though we were originally very calm and cooperative. They acted as if it was our fault and even made a comment about my manners, while they continued to treat us poorly. They were well aware of the situation and knew our flight was arriving with little time to make it to the gate and knew the number of seats that were needed. It was in no way our fault, as we did as we were instructed each step of the way.

Free giveaway headphones were offered to listen to music or watch a show on the drop down from the ceiling TV screens - no screens on the back of the seat in front. Bathroom was kept clean and tidy. A hot towel to refresh was another pleasant perk. Pilots kept us in the loop on the flight's progress. It was a very early morning flight on the first day of the month - the July issue of the inflight magazine was in the pocket and the crossword puzzle was quite engaging.

For this sum of money, I got to sit in 5C, a seat with a malfunctioning belt that refused to lock, I also got boarding privilege of Group 5 and my 2 bags were not the last to come out but close to last. It is an absolute disgrace that AA charges us $64 for an upgrade, for what? Did I mention the gate changes, on Sunday. I checked my gate online, and, I learnt that it was C10. The next day I got a boarding pass that said C7. while seated close to C7 we were told that it would be C8. Well we flew out of C24, I am glad I was paying attention, knowing that with this team anything was possible. AA is a very poorly run organization by people who are beyond caring.

Finally we were allowed to fly again and the staff at the gate seemed to not know where to redirect everyone to. They simply didn't plan ahead in any sort of way. When I was able to get my ticket (because the layover plane I previously had a ticket for has left long before), I had to wait 2 more hours because the flight crew had not arrived. The plane was  more and more delayed. Additionally, they gave no sort of accommodation to make up for the massive time gaps. They sat me and my father in the very back with no hope to move up due to their policy of overbooking. Hands down one of the worst airlines out there.

Even though I asked two employees, nobody could give a definitive answer as to why the flight was delayed 3 hours. I realize that these things happen and my connection had been altered so I wasn't too upset with the changes, but once it was time to board the now 10.30 am flight things started to de-escalate. They boarded some passengers and then stopped and made everyone get off the plane because, our pilot was missing! There was a major miscommunication about where the pilot was and the flight staff didn't have much information to tell us at first. We later found out that he was at least an hour away at another airport in DC. Knowing that I only had a 1 hour layover between my newly rebooked flights, I was panicking. We were finally allowed to re board our flight after many miscommunications about the pilots whereabouts and the flight attendants seemed to find the entire situation comical or maybe they were trying to lighten the mood for their unpleased passengers? The only saving grace in this story is the employee at the gate counter. Without her help I would have certainly missed my connection, but because of her tremendous efforts I was able to make my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Of course, the trip home wasn't quite as terrible, but again I only had one hour to catch my connection and the flight leaving Oklahoma City was 30 minutes late and again I made my connection by 5 minutes.

However, cramping in another seat in every row (3-4-3 instead of 2-5-2) makes traveling really uncomfortable.

They told me that laptop is considered an additional bag and I have to shove it in my backpack to give the illusion that I am carrying 2 bags. On top of everything returning from Philadelphia I had a carry on bag full of glass souvenirs. They wanted me to check in the bag due to no overhead space. I had to empty my carry on to remove all the glass items for me to carry them on to the plane. Lord be hold, I walk on to the plane and there is plenty of room above.

We ended up 5+ hours late and missed connecting flight, having to stay overnight in Seattle and buying new tickets for $350.

american-airlines;2017-06-21;" |  I was scheduled on an American Airlines flight last night from Phoenix to Omaha. We boarded the flight and then was told there was a mechanical. Not a problem. I’m a million miler and understand. As soon as the problem was fixed the pilots timed out. Once again I totally understand. I don’t want a fatigued pilot flying the plane and it is an FAA rule that the airline can’t ignore. The problems started after all this. They said they were getting new pilots and it could take a couple of hours so they wanted everyone to deplane. At this point I’m not thrilled but at least we are going to make it to Omaha and I should be able to at least get in a half a day’s work the next day. We wait for two hours and still no pilots. They make an announcement that the pilots are coming in on a flight in 15 minutes and will be at the gate directly across from us. That was great news but a total lie. A few minutes later I hear someone on a radio say the pilots had never acknowledged the tag. My understanding is pilots never respond to these requests so I’m not sure why they even try or get the passengers hopes up. So the plane lands and deplanes I see the pilots get off and walk away. The gate has still not told anyone. About a half hour later the gate agent announces the flight is officially cancelled. The airline knew there was a shortage of pilots and no one ever accepts a tag so why did they hold us all captive for four hours after they knew the flight would cancel anyway. I would have been fine if as soon as the pilots timed out they cancelled the flight knowing they didn’t have any pilots to cover it. Things like this are why people hate airlines. Not only did they make me miss a whole day of work, they wasted four hours of my day for no reason.";NEGATIVE

Boarding was exactly the same and the extra legroom was minimal. I am 6 foot 3 inches tall and even with the extra space it was pretty close to my knees.

They had me stranded in Charlotte after lying to customers for hours about our delayed flight from Las Vegas to Charlotte.

We finally boarded at 1am, sat there only for them to say the flight was now canceled with no valid reason. The Customer service agents were absolutely awful. Best part of this all is they tell us there are no flights to Charlotte until 10.45pm the following day which was also a lie, they would not offer hotel comp stating that it was weather related delay and they were not responsible for it. So we board a flight to NY, then to Boston get here only to be told that my luggage is in Charlotte and it arrived at 7am, somehow my luggage got here before I did.

I tried to explain that it was a prepackaged AA flight connection that my travel agent booked. She put us on the next flight 2.5 hours later. That flight was nearly full and we were not able to sit next to each other. Also, I had paid for premium seats that we were not able to sit. The customer service agent also refused to refund the extra I paid for the premium seats. To top things off, the new connection flight was 40 minutes late taking off and arriving in Sacramento.

After waiting for over thirty minutes after our flight was supposed to take off we found out that there was no crew for our flight. They then said that they were working on finding one. After two and a half hours they decided that our flight was then cancelled. We then had to wait to rebook and dealt with a very incompetent front desk lady. After it took her 45 minutes to rebook us we had to find a hotel, the airline didn't even offer to pay for it even though it was their fault our flight was cancelled. After a short night in a hotel we had to go back to the airport to catch our new flight. We had been told that we would all be sitting next to each other and that there wouldn't be any delays in our flights. We were mistaken. Once we landed in Phoenix we waited three hours before we even boarded our plane, this was after they did a last minute gate change. Even after we had to wait three hours for our flight, we had to sit on a hot plane for an hour and a half before it even took off. We had been told we would land in Chicago by 2 pm. We didn't arrive until 5.30pm. With myself being pregnant all of these changes, delays, and cancelations were very hard on my body.

I had called ahead to make sure that it wouldn't be a problem to hang it up before we left and was told that the flight attendant would help us find a place for my dress. We had been on four flights and on all of our flights except the last the flight attendants were helpful and polite. Our last flight was an absolute nightmare and everyone with us is very displeased with how poorly we were treated. The flight attendant introduced herself and she was extremely rude and condescending. Entering the plane we encountered the FA and asked if there was a place we could hang my wedding dress? She in return asked where we were seating, so we told her seats 12A and 12C. She curtly told us that because we were not flying first class she could not help us and we would have to put the dress in one of the overhead compartments. I was appalled by how dismissive she was. We quietly took our seats but I absolutely refused to shove my expensive dress above with all the other luggage, so we held the dress in our laps. Another flight attendant from the back came to greet us and was very sweet. She asked about the dress and we told her what happened. I told her how upset I was and she told us she would take care of it. A few moments later we saw her call up to the other flight attendant and it look like they were in a very heated altercation. Eventually the other flight attendant placed the dress in a hanging closed, but from that point on the first FA was even more rude than she was when we first entered the plane. Anytime she would walk by us she would make condescending remarks. When we were exiting the plane and asked for the dress she yet again make uncalled for remarks. We reached out to American airlines to complain about her unacceptable way of treating people, but we were only given a very generic cookie cutter response.

They delayed the flight 10 times before they canceled and changed the gate once which was just after midnight. So I waited seven hours just for them to keep delaying and to cancel. Guess what the reason was? The flight attendant was missing. They put me on another flight that was to leave out at 9:20 the next morning. That following morning we had a gate change and two delays but not by too many minutes. We did arrive on schedule to L.A. but guess what? My bag was kept on the original flight that was cancelled so my bag arrived to L.A before I did. I waited about an hour waiting on my bag at baggage claim thinking that they had it on the flight that I arrived on. I finally went to the back looking around to get answers as to why it was taking my bag so long. I looked at some bags they had positioned at the desk and guess what? One of those bags was mine. I could have saved an hour of time. They are horrible communicators. Very disappointed in my travel experience. The only good things that came out of this was that I arrived home safely, and they put me in a hotel for the night. Do better American Airlines.";NEGATIVE

Then to top it all off we get there today and they move our flight from 7:45 to 11 because the crew ""needs more rest"" - what about all of their customers who have been back and forth due to their lack of planning! Well on top of that they just moved us again to 12:45. No one will help us all they say is its out of their control.

Flight AA1048 was delayed over 4 hours (scheduled departure time was supposedly 3:30pm from Miami and arriving at JFK at 6:30pm), which resulted to my boyfriend and I not making our connecting flight to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. We ended up departing Miami airport at 7:30pm and arriving at JFK at 10:10pm at terminal 8. Our flight back home was scheduled to depart at 10:45pm at terminal 4 with Etihad Airlines. The staff at American Airlines (both at Miami and the JFK airport) had no concept of urgency, sensitivity or care to its passengers. Gate changes were made without clear announcements (D4 to D23) and passengers were not informed in a timely manner about reasons for the flight delay. Sporadic announcements were made when it was clear that passengers were becoming even more restless and agitated as their patience was being stretched beyond their capacity. One bit of information that was announced was that the plane was ready to leave however, the cabin crew was waiting for one flight attendant who was running late. This was actually ridiculous considering the flight was already late for 3 hours and she was still late.  I do acknowledge that the pilot informed us in a timely manner the reasons for the further and ongoing delay, which was nice. Furthermore, I do also acknowledge his amazing pilot skills steering us through the crazy turbulence and landing the plane in such a smooth and gentle way.  AA staff at JFK were rude, abrupt and showed no courtesy. After the plane landed, my boyfriend and I tried to get off the flight as soon as possible and when we managed to get through to the gate front desk, I spoke to a lady explaining to her that my boyfriend and I had a flight in 45min but she just brushed us off and said that since we didn't book the connecting flight with AA, there's nothing they can do. I asked her if it was possible if she could call the other terminal to notify them that we were on the way and she just said, ""Nope we can't do that and there's no way and that we missed our flight considering the time involved with baggage claim"". We asked her how to get to terminal 4 and what was the fastest way and she just advised ""go up that way and follow the signs"" in her monotone. She provided no equitable solution, not even extended a small kind gesture to appease our frustration as it was clear she did not understand the concept of customer service. ";NEGATIVE

However, recent changes will be the driving factor for my migration to a new primary carrier. I don't mind the ability to buy premium seating but it has now grown out of control. American now intentionally forces me in a seat that is not my preference just so they can sucker me into paying for my desired position.  The additional requirements preventing carry on baggage for economy coach, again could be bearable but only if the carrier holds itself to a higher turnaround time (which it does not).

I was then directed by Latam airlines (connecting airlines) to an American Airlines office. sadly no one was working at this office at 4 pm. I was then directed to call a local number. no one answered the line. I then used my cell phone to make an hour long international call, costing me 100 dollars (I have the bill) for my flight to be rescheduled for 10 hours later. So, 2 nights later, with about 6 hours total sleep time, my wife and I arrived at our final destination. The trip took 36 hours instead of 12. Of course, this completely changed our plans, cost me money, and caused me to experience a health problem. When I described my travel difficulties to an American Airlines representative, I was told that there were no guidelines that would fulfill my request for a refund.

After exiting security and returning to the check in area, I approached an attendant and kindly asked him if anyone had turned in a debit card as I had lost mine, the guy doesn't even look up from what he is doing and rudely yells ""did anyone turn in a debit card? No?"" Then looks at me and says ""retrace your steps, it's not my problem."" Finally I get past security and to my gate, we board the plane and begin to take off. A passenger gets sick before we even take off so we return to the gate, completely understandable. After waiting for 30 minutes for them to clean up, we are informed that they need to ""wax the plane down"" which took another 45 minutes. It was at this point that the pilot stated that he informed all AA crew we were delayed so we could get to our connecting flights in Charlotte. 45 minutes into the ""waxing"" we were informed we were returning to the gate yet again due to possible damage to the tail. I needed to get to Buffalo that night due to an important engagement early the next day so I decided to exit the plane and attempt to get on another flight that night. The flight attendant rudely stated overhead that anyone exiting the plane would not be welcome back on if they took off soon. My last straw was booking another flight and due to AA already rebooking my Charlotte flight for the next evening, they were refusing to put me on a flight that left that night so I had to repurchase another ticket with the ""possibility of a refund"" which was eventually denied. Everyone from the checkin counter to the flight attendants and gate staff were awful. I don't even think they know what being polite or a smile is.

Only negative was the headrest, which was not well padded. Large movie selection. Excellent preordered food, but very restricted wine selection. Liked especially the ice-cream Sundae. Pilot had been sucked in a huge traffic jam, so arrived about 40 minutes after the plane should have taken off. Additionally evening air traffic delay at JFK, so that the plane departed about 2 hours late. Made up some of this delay, but we arrived nevertheless 40 minutes late. Very strange baggage delivery in San Diego, belt changed three times before they started delivery. in summary a quite good flight and service.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2017-05-22;" |  I was appalled by the last of service and poor treatment given to me by American Airlines today. I have an extra three hours to wait at the airport and write this review because I was bumped from my connecting flight without any notice or compensation. The first flight was delayed an hour and fifteen minutes due to mechanical issues. Apparaty a bird had crashed into the plane the night before. So rather than have the issue fixed before takeoff, they make an entire plane full of passengers wait on a hot, sticky plane for an hour. Because the plane departed late American Airlines rebooked all passengers with connecting flights. I was one of them, the problem is that my connecting flight was delayed so I made the flight with time to spare. The aircraft didn't even change, the same plane I took on the first flight was also the same plane I would have taken for the second flight. But did American Airlines care? No! They bumped me from the flight I was supposed to be on and gave my seat away. The flight was of course overbooked - as per usual for American Airlines. After being treated rudely by the gate manager I went to customer service to ask for a refund (I knew I wouldn't get it but hey, never hurts to ask) and was told the best he could offer was a $12 meal voucher. Wow. To contest this further I have to send them an email but I am sure I will never be compensated or given an apology. Badly done American, Badly done.";NEGATIVE

We had issues on our way to Barcelona with British Airways and back with American. Both times we were greeted with customer service that was quite awful. There were a few friendly faces, but what affected me most was the check-in lady who literally yelled at me and the people in front of us in line and then a flight attendant who also yelled at me about food on the flight, because I had my headphones in and missed her when she first spoke. When I removed my earbud and said sorry, she then proceeded to refuse me service. I come from hospitality and I know it's a tough job...but I also know you stay positive no matter what. I can honestly say I'll never book American again - if I'm almost to tears twice because of people due to flying then I will say that is enough. Goodbye American.";NEGATIVE

After the horror ripped baggage and damaged articles experience the previous trip I regret giving American Airlines another chance. After 2-3 months of explaining and convincing I finally was offered some compensation. The only reason I decided to take America again because of the $100 gift card they offered. Last week, I relocated completely from NY to TX. I literally moved my entire house from one coast to the other, and without any consideration to that AA charged me $100 for 3 pounds extra. Yes you heard it right, $100 for 3 pounds! The guy at the counter apparently had no power to let ""3 pounds"" in a check in bag go or make any exceptions and I contact customer care to take care of this later on, but all I get is a couple of copy-pasted auto replies from customer service and then they disappear completely. Maybe AA uses the strategy of ""let the customer lose patience waiting for our reply"". That way the case dies a natural death! No consideration to customer satisfaction whatsoever.";NEGATIVE

This was a late evening flight that got delayed by half an hour (and for the first time on American I heard the pilot actually acknowledge and apologize). Security at O'Hare was a bit of a zoo and most food outlets were shutting down as I got through. Since I have status and the cost would be $80 I paid for two 500 mile upgrade vouchers in the hope of getting bumped. My seat was already in main cabin extra with reasonable legroom, and I fly this route at least monthly but given the late hour and my hunger I thought I would enjoy an upgrade. The product was very disappointing and not worth $80. We were offered nuts which I can't eat due to an allergy. I was given a snack pack as an alternative. I was in seat 3E, legroom wasn't amazing. Seat comfort was ok but nothing special. I had a couple of drinks. Food and beverage value maybe $35 for a snack pack and a couple of whiskies (but they often comp your second if you buy two in economy so not that good). Slightly better seat but not much better than main cabin extra. No meal, no entertainment. Wifi is paid for either way and I never use it. I really feel ripped off, the upgrade really isn't worth the difference.";NEGATIVE

This airline assumes no responsibility for the services that it sells to their customers. Three of us left Palm Springs (flight AA3076) on a beautiful day with hopes of connecting to our flight in Phoenix that was to bring us back to Boston (flight AA2341). Upon arrival to Phoenix our flight was running late, the flight attendant was aware of 2 groups of people with tight connections and all they did was to tell the plane to let those with tight connections to get off 1st and both groups were in the back of the airplane. We know how that worked out, we all got off last. They did not call the tower to say we were running late as reported to me by the person at the gate for Boston. There was only 30 minutes between reported landing time in Phoenix and lift off time to Boston if the 1st flight arrived on time. The gates were over 1/2 mile apart. I was the youngest in our group of three turning 65 this year and the oldest was 82. This information is all known by the airline upon booking a ticket on line. I ran to the gate for flight AA2341 and was told the doors were closed and are always closed 15 minutes before take off. I asked if she could call to see if the doors could be opened and she refused. The plane did not disconnect from gate for at least 6 more minutes. How is an 82 year old man suppose to walk 1/2 + miles to a connecting flight when seated in the back of the plane which takes 6-10 minutes to get out of allowing only 5-9 minutes of walking time (if it lands on time and it did not)? At the service desk rule 240 was not applied which entitles us to the first flight to Boston on any airline not just American which we were forced to do getting us home an entire day late. I emailed to customer relations who responded in a way that was unacceptable (basically saying sorry but there is nothing that can be done). I asked her to have a supervisor get back to me and not one response has been sent my way in over 2 weeks. The company needs some hospitality training.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2017-05-12;" |  London to Colorado Springs via Dallas. After reading the reviews, before my flight earlier this month, I was concerned to say the least. Dreading my upcoming flight almost. But, after having flown Delta to Colorado Springs in December 2016. I am pleased to be able to say the conditions on AA main cabin were as good as, if not better in one area, as Delta. I can't actually see the justification for bad reviews in main cabin. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The seat pitch was fine. I would go as far to say I feel like I had more leg room on AA than I did on Delta, but the seat width is noticeably less than other flights I've been on. Thankfully there was a seat between myself and the other passenger in my row, otherwise we would literally be squashed in, banging elbows and almost would be impossible to eat comfortably without encroaching on the space of the person next to you. I was contemplating paying extra for main cabin extra, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. I would save your money as I couldn't see any significant difference in leg room, although it's supposed to provide an additional 6 inches. I wasn't uncomfortable in normal main cabin where I'd see paying extra worthwhile. Food is to be as expected when flying economy, it was acceptable but I've had better presented, tastier food on economy with other airlines. Drink choice was bare minimum acceptable.  Not the best economy experience I've had, but acceptable. Cabin crew service was polite and friendly. Nothing really to comment on over and above what's expected. IFE was actually quite good. Lots of choice with current and classic movie choices. Overall. Not a bad experience. Certainly better than I expected.";POSITIVE

I went to the counter and asked if I was at the right gate, and they said yes, but they couldn't change the sign because the plane that was at that gate wasn't able to pull out. They didn't give much of an explanation, but our aircraft was there, but wasn't able to get to the gate. At no point did they give an announcement to inform the customers. Eventually they re-routed the flight to the next gate and everyone deplaned. I knew I would miss my next flight, so I was able to get a new ticket from another counter prior to departing. When I got to Dallas I went to the customer service counter and despite a line that extended down the airport corridor, there were only 2 attendants present. Surprised me since they knew how many people missed flights with the three aircraft that were late arrivals. Eventually they did get other attendants, but it took 1.5 hours to get to the counter. When I inquired about lodging she informed me that it was due to weather! I couldn't believe it.";NEGATIVE

A pre departure beverage followed by what turned out to be a 1 hour delay due to a maint issue in the cargo hold. Updates from the cockpit every 10 minutes, additional beverages offered and everyone was allowed to use their phones and the restrooms during the delay. Off the gate 1 hr late, a 15 minute taxi and we were airborne. A round of drinks with American's signature warm nuts were offered, followed by Lunch, with a very tasty appetiser, for the main I choose pasta, with a fresh side salad. Warm Rolls were offered, followed by an excellent Cheese Cake with caramel topping dessert. Drinks continued until decent. A fairly quick arrival and we arrived at the gate only 16 minutes late. Stayed in the Admirals Club in CLT, Term B for 90 minutes then boarded a B738 to DCA. This time in Main Cabin Extra. Good Legroom with a standard economy class seat. Full flight tonight, 59 minutes in the air, a quick, but full beverage service. I was on the ground and at my DCA hotel before our scheduled arrival time.

However, the organisation at the airport was awful as there is no American Airlines desk in Hong Kong airport so a lot of waiting around with nobody telling us what was going to happen. I had two onward flights to catch, one connecting from LAX-JFK with American Airlines and one the following day with JetBlue. As the delay got pushed back further and further (more than 15hrs) with the first leg, it turned out I was missing both connections. I called up AA and they would offer no compensation for this delay. At this point I had paid a change of flight fee to JetBlue and had paid for a hotel in New York. In the end, after not backing down, they said they would issue me a $300 voucher for use on AA. However, they will only issue the voucher by post. 8 weeks went by, no voucher. I've spoken to them and they told me they cannot give it out electronic vouchers by email because I do not have US address (come on..what year is this?), so I am still waiting. Overall I experienced pretty appalling service.";NEGATIVE

The airplane had already landed and we were waiting our turn to stop at the gate, which was taking a while, I needed to go to the restroom really bad, and since I didn't know how much longer it would take, I decided to get and go. I told the flight attendant in the rear of the airplane that I needed to go really bad, the other flight attendant in the front, who never bothered to ask if I had any health issues that would force me to go even if it wasn't the appropriate time, simply said in the mic for the entire flight to hear, ""we are all going to have to wait here until this person in the restroom returns to his seat.""

About an hour or so before my flight I was notified that my flight was delayed until 9:15pm which meant I would miss my connecting flight. When I went to the ticket counter, there was no rep there. I waiting with another passenger for around 30 min before a rep showed up. When I was finally able to ask her what was going on with my flight she informed me that they had canceled the flight and that it would be leaving the following morning. When I asked her why she said they didn't have enough people to man the flight. I asked her to put me on another flight, but there were no more flights that day. Keep in mind this was around 6pm. When I asked for a refund she said she couldn't do that and looked away from me back at her screen. When I asked how to get a refund she told me in a very sarcastic voice to ""just call American."" At that point I unloaded on her and her horrible customer service and went to Delta and bought another ticket for $171.38. When I called AA to get a refund they told me it would take up to 10 days and that they couldn't tell me what amount would be refunded. I waited 11 days with no refund. When I called back in to AA they said no one had filled the refund. Once again I had to go through the process and wait. I finally go a notice that my refund of $115 was being ""processed"" but could take up to 5 days to complete. When I reached someone in customer service they seemed very unapologetic, like I was a nuisance. I tried to get someone to explain to me why my refund, which should have been $214 because of the seats I purchased, was so low they said, ""that is the amount our refund department issues."" No other explanation was given. I have since canceled my AAdvantage membership and made sure that anyone in my company that flies does not use American or any affiliate.

We land in Dallas I run ( yes as people made comments about me running). I get to the gate before listed departure but 7 minutes after flight is closed. The funniest part is took me 6 minutes to get from gate to gate but I was 7 minutes late and I couldn't run fast enough? WTF I don't know or have ever seen someone run so fast time went backwards-have you? They didn't hold flight 1 minute for me even though they knew I was there trying to get on flight but running late because of them American not me. Basically flights with connections are just bait to get your money when they don't care about you. Then the 2nd flight is with an American partner (American Eagle) who says there is nothing they can do for me as my reason for missing the flight is not there fault but can get me a discount hotel room for $100 a night and put me on the first flight in the morning.

The gate was close to the Admiral's Lounge at Terminal 8 and I was able to spot the aircraft while being seated in the so called ""bureau""-section. Boarding started well ahead of the actual departure time and there seemed to be a very light load on this short hop to Boston. I only noticed upon boarding that this aircraft had a three-cabin-configuration and is usually used for transcontinental flights. As a frequent flyer I was assigned a seat in the C-class section. I was able to stretch out and use the interactive map. Doors were closed 15 minutes before departure and there were no delays on the tarmac and runway either. The friendly crew even managed to serve all passengers a softdrink and a cookie. Take notice: This was a 42-minutes-flight only.

There was no cabin crew interaction with fare paying passengers for the majority of both flights. There was no provision of water to keep passengers hydrated for an exceptionally long flight. There were no young staff as part of the cabin crew. I have been told the more mature cabin crew are very obsessive over staffing the long haul routes. What a shame. Pity they lack customer service. Also, I was witness to a male cabin crew member telling a young mother holding a baby to sit down in a not so very nice tone of voice, until they were finished working.

The gate attendant asked me to test it in the check bag container and after fitting perfectly (I was on two day business trip) she tells me the bag is too large. I was perplexed and handed them my bag. The two passengers in front of me were carrying larger bags and large computer bags. One was a AA employee, of course they were not asked to check their bag. The traveler behind me acknowledged how strange the interaction was and that my bag was clearly not too large. I am livid as I sit and watch bag after bag roll by me. Now as I land at my home destination instead of walking to my car, I will be sitting at the baggage claim. Classy AA.

I have used American Airlines twice now to take this trip, and they completely ruined my vacation both times. Last year, my flight was delayed twice leaving my first airport. This caused me to miss my connecting flight. Then they re-routed me, which added an additional stop, after hours of dealing with rescheduling flights, I got on my flight from Dallas to Portland. Sat on the tarmac for 3 hours then that flight was cancelled. Then I had to wait in line for hours to reschedule yet again. I lost a day and a half of my vacation because of the delays. This year (last week) I was scheduled to fly out at 5:50pm. got to the airport to check in, and my flight had been canceled due to the AC on the plane being broken - they couldn't schedule me for another flight out until the next morning. Also, rescheduling resulted in adding an additional stop to my trip. I missed an entire day of this vacation, and had to cancel reservations as a result. They gave me a $200 voucher. Seriously? I don't even want to fly with them again. what good is a voucher going to do? Disgusting!";NEGATIVE

We sat at both airports watching American Airlines flights being delayed and canceled. We were not the only ones. I will never fly AA again. Basically anyone was fortunate if they left on time. I was totally shocked. I really almost feel sorry for the gate personnel. It is no wonder that were telling people that “It is just your tough luck”, they have to be ashamed and sick of it themselves. While waiting in St. Louis, the gate personnel did not want to give out meal vouchers. One lady apparently aware that after such a wait that we were entitled to meal vouchers got up and asked for the meal voucher, the gate personnel whispered, “If I give you one I have to give everyone one.” Let me tell you about a similar experience I had with Southwest Airlines recently. The same delay happened and after a couple of hours the gate personnel started playing a game with everyone at the gate. They started giving mileage vouchers for the delay. I have flown for years and I have never had such incompetent, terrible service. The only way I will ever fly AA again would be that it is my only option and I have to use AA.";NEGATIVE

Arriving from Chicago to El Paso the flight was decent because i had the air vent full blast which helped from feeling anxiety. but returning home was a emotional disaster. I paid $90 for me and my husband for leg room and just to find that the only seats available in the main cabin had a low overhead, the air vent had hardly any pressure, tight seat belts, and I was continually bumped every time stewardess pass. After everyone boarded and a few minutes afterwards, the captain announced there was engine problem and there would be a delay. Immediately I began to panic because I couldn't get the air vent to work. I informed the stewardess several times with tears steaming down my face, that I was freaking out and I needed air, and she informs me that once the plane took off, I would get more air. After waiting 30 long minutes on the runway, the plane finally took off and a guy sitting next row saw the panic and my knees shaking, he attempted to help with the air vent. There were four empty seats in front of me and not once did either cabin staff attempt to accommodate nor ask me why I was crying.  Meantime my husband tried to fix the air vent but to no avail. Also the low overhead was so inconvenient and with me crying, he tried to fan me with a magazine, so I know he was miserable as well.  Next time i will spend the extra $100 bucks or more and fly with another airline.";NEGATIVE

My family and I were taking our first family vacation in 20 years, as there are 9 of us, we booked our flight almost a year in advance to ensure that we would sit together, especially since my 2 year old niece would be coming as well and it was her first time flying. About a month before our trip we were told that all of our seats were changed and none of us could sit together. They had my 2 year old niece sitting in a seat alone. When we called to sort this out we encountered nothing but pure rudeness and constant transfers. After 4 hours (no exaggeration) on the phone trying to just change one seat so my niece wasn't alone, we were told there was nothing we could do and would have to try and change our seat at the airport, mere hours before we were supposed to take off and that nothing was guaranteed. We started out in Philly, flying to Orlando. The entire staff was rude, yelling at passengers as we tried to board the plane telling us that we had to check our carry on bags because there was no space left on the plane. After all the chaos, she was able to sit with her daughter and a nice man switched seats with her husband, so my niece was able to fly with both her parents by her side. Once we got on board there was plenty of room for additional carry ons, some overhead compartments were completely empty. We had a wonderful vacation and then on the flight back home we had the same issue. My entire family was spread throughout the plane and once again my 2 year old niece was booked in a seat alone. The staff on the flight coming home were much nicer and much more accommodating but it wasn't confirmed that my sister would be able to sit with her daughter until literally 1 minute before we boarded. As we were attempting to switch her seats we met several other families that had the same issues as we did. Countless children 7 and younger were seated alone and apart from their families. And AA didn't extend an apology nor an explanation as to why they needed to separate everyone. I will never fly this airline again. I'd much rather give my hard earned money to an airline that would accommodate my family and I. What a terrible experience.";NEGATIVE

There were other passengers standing around her - clearly waiting for her to finish.

Then she thrust the bottle into my hands and as I turned away she said, ""Hold up! Where do you think you are going with that bottle of water!"" Another passenger around us took some empty cups and passed to me as we poured each other water and did not want to get in the way of this flight attendant's anger.

When she came to my row (which is not far from the front), I used my most friendly voice to ask her could she tell me what kind of sandwich are were. To my surprise, she gave out a loud and exasperated sigh - turned to ask her colleague about the type of sandwich, turned to me and said, ""it's turkey, turkey!""

My American Airlines flight which left on February 22 at 1:30 pm was already closing, so I had started to run. I finally arrived, out of breath and about to collapse. The gate lady let me quickly run across the hall to purchase a bottle of water before I dehydrate. Finally on the plane. I sat a good 10 minutes in stillness, trying to catch my breath. I wanted to get comfortable and ""set up"" for a transatlantic flight when I noticed that I had lost my cellphone! I ran up to the stewardess and explained my situation. She calmed me well, but explained that I couldnt leave the plane. Another staff came up and inquired what was wrong. I told them I needed to leave and get my phone, thinking I hopefully left it by the gate or the small store across the hall. He walked out and some minutes later returned with my phone. My vacation was saved and I couldn't thank him enough. Both of those flight attendants had done such an awesome job at calming and fixing the whole ordeal.

american-airlines;2017-03-30;" |  American Airlines flight from Milwaukee to Chicago was showing as delayed by 35 minutes upon our arrival to airport. No problem as we had 1 x 2.5 hour layover for a connecting flight. However, time went on and the departure time kept getting extended for no reason given. We were instructed that the flight would still occur. When the flight showed a departure time of 9.51 (almost 2 hours past its original time - and keep in mind the flight is only a 45 minute flight from Milwaukee to Chicago), I went up to find out what was going on. Fortunately a pilot was there and told me that the 1st plane had mechanical issues and then another was sent for and it returned for mechanical issues and that they were looking for another plane. They were talking about getting a bus to send passengers to Chicago. Unfortunately, that would no longer be an option as it would take at least 2 hours to drive, park and get to gate - which means we would be missing our connecting flight. Why didn't someone make that decision sooner - or at least let us know as I could have driven to Chicago or got my own transportation. No communication. When a gate agent finally arrived, she said she could change our flight to get us to our destination, but it was not leaving until 4 pm (we had been at the airport since 6.20 am). So now we had to wait until 4 pm to leave and it was 10 am at that point. We were later given some food vouchers by a ticketing agent as the gate agent seemed to think that this was normal for AA and she agreed with us but there was nothing she could do. When we tried to use the vouchers - which states only good for food and beverages - at Nonna's restaurant, they refused to honor part of it as we had two drinks with our food and they stated that it did not include alcoholic beverages - which it does not state on the voucher anywhere. Again, more issues. We finally arrived at our destination over 7 hours late (which is big in a short 4 day vacation). The experience was terrible all around. So much so that we are looking at cancelling our Citi Advantage card and never flying AA again.";NEGATIVE

Customer service slowly and painfully manually checked us all in and took our luggage. When returning from Santiago, we arrived at the airport ready to encounter the same issue. This time, the kiosks once again did not work, but the customer assistance agent would not let us all enter the line to get manually checked in. Instead, they roped off the entrance to the EMPTY line and ""had to talk to the manager first."" We explained that there were 45 people under one reservation code and the kiosks would not check us in, but they were adamant about having each of us wait for the kiosk to give us an error code and then get in line for customer service. I explained that we would all miss our flight if all of us had to wait in line for a kiosk, error code, and then for customer assistance. After ""talking to the manager,"" the agent offered to check half of us in, not that this makes any sense because all 45 of us had a ticket number to board the same plane. Finally, after ignoring the agent and just entering the line, our bus driver came to argue with them as well to let the rest of the group through. The agents denied that 45 could possibly be under one confirmation code and have a group reservation (Why else would 45 people show up at the airport together?). Eventually, they let everyone through, did not find more agents to assist the line, and clearly had not communication amongst themselves. Luckily, everyone got through security in time for the flight, but I'm sure if some of us hadn't just ignored them all together, some would not have. The woman also printed my first boarding pass twice instead of printing my boarding pass for both legs of the trip, thank god the kiosk before security during my layover worked, or I would have missed my connecting flight since there were no attendees at the counter in Miami.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2017-03-16;" |  St. Louis to Chicago. I’m completely devastated. My husband and I have been married for three years, but we never had a honeymoon. So we saved up our money to decide where we would go within the next five years. He had to have major surgery, so we scheduled for this year. He’s never flown before and was excited and anxious. We made a reservation with Carnival Cruise to coincide with our anniversary but before his surgery, because life is short. Everything was fine as we filled up our Expedition for the two hour drive to Lambert Airport. We found parking and got on the park shuttle. I knew a little bit from prior experience, but my husband was worried and nervous. The first thing out of place I noticed was when we were at the gate waiting to board. The captain and crew got on about ten minutes before we were called to board. There was a request for anyone with a carryon with wheels to check them at the desk due to a full plane. As we boarded I noticed the captain laughing and holding a conversation with two flight attendants already aboard. Then the problems started. It took a while because the flight attendants were trying to find space overhead for everyone’s carry-ons (we didn’t have any.) The captain taxied off, then stopped. He told us we had to wait awhile for the plane to be de-iced. (That took 50 minutes.)  He taxied again and went around three times. Finally, he told us that his compass wasn’t aligned and he needed to have maintenance take a look at it. But, there was no gate available, so we would have to wait until one opened for him to dock. (That took another 30 minutes.) During this wait, one of the female flight attendants told us to call or go online to rebook if we had connecting flights out of Chicago. I called immediately and was told by a representative she could not rebook us while we were still on the plane. I explained that we needed to catch our connecting flight from Chicago at 8:30am and if we missed it we would miss our cruise. Absolutely no sympathy given. Finally we docked. After 30 more minutes of uncertainty, the captain told us the plane is being put out of service. I called the cruise line for help to get to our port in Miami, while my husband called American Airlines to see what can be done. We got off the plane and was told little to no info. We asked where our luggage would be and told it would be held until we had another flight. The rep found us another flight, but it would make it there after the cruise had already departed. Mind you, one flight had already boarded and ready to leave at 7:19am. Too bad we were stuck on the tarmac. The cruise line couldn’t find a plane for us because all flights were booked and full. We made several phone calls trying to salvage our delayed honeymoon to no avail. Finally, we accepted defeat and requested a refund and looked for our luggage. This turned into another time consuming ordeal. We drove back home dejected. It was a very quiet two hour drive. We had a million questions and no answers. I called the cruise line as soon as we got home to see if we could book another one. I found one sailing 3/16/17 after working with a remarkable woman. Unfortunately, there were no flights available. I accepted defeat once again and was given options that made it worse. I couldn't add the rest of the letter I sent them both. ";NEGATIVE

My flight from Madison was at 2.56 pm, then it was delayed to 4.30, then to 6 and to 7 and 7.30. After I arrived to Chicago my flight to Dayton was cancelled due to no crew. The person who helped me with rebooking told me that I have an option to buy another ticket. This made me furious, what should I buy another ticked for a cancelled flight? He rebooked a flight from Chicago to Philadelphia and from Philadelphia to Dayton. He gave me a voucher for food which was not enough and had to pay extra money out of my pocket. The hotel was in Schaumburg and had to take a taxi back to the airport at 2.30 am as the shuttle did not start until 6 am. It cost me $75 for the taxi. I will never fly with American Airlines. It was a nightmare experience.";NEGATIVE

I found a great ticket price and thought the drive to Cincinatti was worth the hundred dollars I saved however, the experience is one I will never forget. The best I can say is you get what you pay for. Although the inflight service was excellent in the old planes and the flight attendants were warm and grand, the check-in counter people are subpar and definitely not worth the hassle of traveling with the company. I have chosen to just pay the extra dollars, plan ahead of time, and never fly with American Airlines again. The online response team gets back to you quickly with a response. However, the experience of the check-in counter people is amazing to me. They are slow. Which in my observation is not a ticket counter issue but a archaic technology issue. For sure you need to get to the airport 1.5 hours early because simply checking in takes 15-20 minutes per person. I didn't see anyone come to the front and get thru their process swiftly. As management chooses to assist who they want to assist with great customer service, I can truly say you should choose a different company if you want quality.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2017-03-13;" |  Flew American Airlines from Denver to Liberia via Miami. I had eight people on a flight for my wedding to Costa Rica through Miami. They boarded the plane 15 minutes early (of course we were delayed taking off for 45 minutes) so when we arrived at the designated boarding time the agent informs us our carry on bags will have to be checked. When I say that's fine but ask if anything can be done about the wedding dress she immediately becomes rude saying we should have been there on time. Apparently we should have known they were boarding early. She demands the boarding passes if we want to make the flight at all. As I am trying to get all 8 separated from the connecting flight boarding passes she threatens to keep me off the plane ""if I throw one more boarding pass at her"". I was sliding them off the stack of paper I was holding onto the counter. None touched her or even went to the edge. She comes around the counter to tag our bags telling me I would have had to check mine anyway. I responded that I've never had any problem with it as a carry on in 5 years with numerous airlines. She pointed to the expander zippers being opened as her rationale. I took the boarding passes from her and she said that she could keep me off the plane until I cooled down and that she was going to tell the pilot about me. I did not raise my voice, curse, or even argue at any point throughout this encounter. I said nothing and boarded the flight as I needed to get to my wedding. Once onboard there were at least 5 overhead compartments with room for the dress. Begging the flight attendants did absolutely nothing and they closed the half full compartments. After talking to several other people apparently we were no the only people treated poorly by the desk agent. However, repeated attempts to file a complaint with American have resulted in nothing more than a complete brush off.";NEGATIVE

This caused 6 hours of chaos. First and last time with this airline.;NEGATIVE

We arrived but the baggage wasn't there. They sent us from Terminsl C to Terminal D to receive the baggage. Arriving at the baggage claim area, there was a staff member who wasn't willing to help at all. He was calling some customer service counter where nobody was available pretending that he was doing something. As I was furious, we asked for a supervisor, then he called someone else, again we had to repeat the story. Anyway, after 4 hours of waiting in the airport we received our bag and could finally leave to the hotel to get some rest. In the morning, went back to the airport for the next flight, asked for a supervisor. The lady wasn't even willing to talk to us. She was looking around as we were complaining and stopped us saying you only talk about ""negatives"" I can't do anything about it. There was 3 other people with different problems over there. Awful service! Last time travelling with them.";NEGATIVE

The thing looks great, lots of storage space, great in flight entertainment system and very decent food. Staff was pleasant. It all went a bit downhill when I tried to sleep. The seat is awkward and asymmetrical when flat. It's very hard and really tight in places. In my case, seat 2D, the left armrest goes down while the right is fixed meaning great shoulder space on your left and squuezed in on the right. There is a big pad on the right side of the seatbelt which gets in your way every time you turn over. Also the tray does not stow away which means you bang your knee every time you turn. When lying on your side one side is quite restricted with regards to bending your knee. Altogether these things seriously impact sleep quality and I wonder if they tested them extensively before introducing them.";POSITIVE

From the moment I was in line at Houston IAH to head to my destination, to my return to Houston, the people that represent AA lacked customer service skills. The officer reviewing passports at IAH was extremely rude and sarcastic to every person that went through her line. She talked down to paying passengers with no provocation from them. She was making it clear to passengers that she had been there since 2:30 am. Perhaps she needs to find another position more suited to her so that she does not take out her displeasure with her work schedule on paying and unsuspecting passengers. On my return flight, my bag did not arrive on the same plane as I had. It was delivered the next day. At home when I opened my suitcase, I noticed that I was missing a bag of clothes.  I called AA lost/missing baggage department and yet again, the agent was rude and lacked customer skills.";NEGATIVE

We were charged to recheck our luggage in Dallas before being allowed to board our flight to Houston, even though this policy is listed nowhere on the AA website or in any of the emails I received from them, not even in the fine print. We were basically extorted $65 with no alternative option other than to leave our professional equipment behind or lose our seats on the non-refundable flight. This was such a blatant scam, I am honestly appalled that something like this can even happen. Also, good luck ever getting ahold of a human being - we called customer service and they wouldn't even talk to us. We had to express all of our concerns over email. Neither of us or our families will ever fly with American again no matter how much money we will have to pay to any other airlines. ";NEGATIVE

Then had to wait to board connecting flight for another attendant to show up. On the way back, had to wait in the plane as apparently no one told the ramp operator that we were there.

If the attendant would have just helped us we wouldn't have been forced to stay a night and get placed on stand by. To top it off she was rude as hell towards us.

The usual limited poor selection of food which fortunately we could avoid as managed to grab a quick bite in transit at ORD before boarding. Only redeeming features were the fact that the flight left and arrived early, the plane was not full (seems most American airlines fly the smallest planes possible with maximum capacity. Smart business perhaps but does little for comfort) and one of the FA's was friendly, polite and unusually interested in the passengers. Other than that, it was hard to imagine it was an international flight.";NEGATIVE

The plane was rammed as pretty much always but the saving grace was the seat back TV's with quality programming. As a family of 5 we don't have screens each, let alone travel with that many, as much as AA asserts that 90% of passengers do. Also benefitted from a very attentive and friendly FA who went out of her way to get me some milk, as opposed to cream, for my tea. Contrasting experience to 2 years ago on a flight with AA when I was literally scolded for asking that the cream not be put in to the hot water before a tea bag was put in. This was the 4th AA flight and 3 of those included FAs who were very much not part of the normal experience. Food options are seriously challenging for those unable to grab something before the flight. 4 of us opted for the $10 cheese platter which is about the best thing on offer. The other selected an overly loaded virtually inedible turkey and apple croissant sandwich.";POSITIVE

I called American Airlines, they said I couldn't get a refund, but I could apply this money to a different trip. Fair enough. Forward six month later and apparently they have no record of my credit to put towards another flight. I then go and book my new flight and put a complaint in that I couldn't use my credit. I get a call back and the next day and they now said I could, and that the only way I could apply this partial credit would be to cancel my current flight, wait 14 days for the reimbursement, then call them back to schedule another flight with this credit applied. Seriously, why couldn't you just apply to the flight I already booked that day, instead of having me jump through hoops.

I was left alone and nobody told me what to do at this point leaving me speechless and vulnerable, this was only beginning of a nightmare. A manager of restaurant, not the airline, took care of me. Brought me to Customer service booth were they offered to rebook me next day. I then spent the night at the airport. As I explained to them my concern of beeing left alone for a full 24hr in an airport they said they would accomodate me: they gave me a voucher of a pitty hotel smelling cigarette, 12$us for next 24hrs. I ended up booking a night at Marriott to my own charge and all food until next flight since they give nothing on the planes. When I finally got back home, luggage haven't followed.

While they searched for a plane I chatted with another customer who flies AA several times a month, she informed me it's actually rare when a flight they've sold tickets for is not missing either the plane or the flight crew, and that AA is always understaffed. They finally get us boarded, but we're severely delayed. We arrive at Denver, and find out that another delayed AA flight is parked at our gate and DEN doesn't have a spare gate to give to an airline that can't get any of its flights in and out on time. We end up sitting on the tarmac for 30-45 minutes waiting for the other plane to leave. End up getting off the plane an hour and a half late.

When I called to have my tickets cancelled, I was made aware I would be refunded nothing, despite booking and cancelling the flights almost 3 months in advance. Thus I spent over 300 dollars for literally nothing. This is outrageous and unethical, and American Airlines must advertise themselves more faithfully.

When we arrived at the gate we had our boarding passes that had been issued in London (I was travelling with my brother) I went through fine but they stopped my brother and told him they had changed his seat. I asked the incompetent at the gate why? No apology in any form I was just told it was nothing to do with him and he couldn't do anything. I asked for the purser once on board and these 2 women turned up one was the purser and one was ground crew when we explained that we were not happy that this had happened they again gave no apology and said they it wasn't to do with them and what did they expect me to do throw people out of their seats? (ironic as this is just what they did to us). When we pointed out that there was something wrong with a system that allowed this to happen the purser got defensive and threatened to have us thrown off the aircraft. Just bullying us. All the time this was happening this was stood up in front of all the passengers a very unpleasant experience and dreadful customer service. The plane was tired, narrow seats that when you tried to lie down you felt that you were in a coffin, no built in entertainment centre, I didn't eat dinner but had breakfast which was appalling. All the crew were wearing different clothes so they had no attention to detail and no uniform in the true sense of the word.This is the worst airline I have ever flown. I am now 60 and I have being flying since I was 7. American Airlines do not understand in any way what Business class passengers require.";NEGATIVE

After contacting American Airlines before touchdown in San Francisco, I was informed that they would put me up in a hotel and my flight would be changed to the next night. When I arrived at the terminal in San Francisco, I went to the American Airline desk and asked who I could talk to about my accommodation due to my missed flight. The first thing the women, who ended up being a supervisor, said to me was ""Well what time is your flight?"" I responded and told her that my flight to Sydney was supposed to depart at 11:25 pm -- her response, ""Well, it's only 10:50"". From there on I was in complete shock, what kind of response is that? I felt as though she was making assumptions about what I knew/ did not know before even asking me my name or flight number. I explained to her that I was already booked on another flight for the next night and for anyone who has flown internationally, as well as ever been to the San Francisco airport, knows it would be impossible for me to have made that flight (I was also already told prior to landing that they would not hold my flight to Sydney and there was nothing they could do except accommodate me). She then proceeded to tell me there was nothing she could do because the delay was due to the weather and not mechanics which sounds ridiculous to me. Not once did she ask me my name, my flight or anything. She was very inconsiderate and made me feel like this problem was my fault and it was not her's to deal with. She handed me a slip with an 800 number that I could call for a hotel. My main issues with the situation above were that from the start there were inconsistencies with their accommodations and what their employees are told. No one should have told me I would have been put up in a hotel if that was untrue. Second, was that this woman could not have cared less about a paying customer.  American Airlines, you could not have put me up in a hotel for ~$100 when I paid over $1000 to fly with you? I hopefully will never have to fly with American Airlines again.";NEGATIVE

We made it to the airport 1 hour 15 minutes prior to our flight departure. Upon arriving at the check in desk we were not allowed to print our boarding passes. There were 4 women working the desk and we were informed we were too late to check in. After explaining our delays beyond our control they still refused our check in. I was referred to a ""supervisor"". After explaining our situation once again, she completely ignored me. I asked repeatedly for her help in at least letting us try to make our flight and I was met with disrespect, dirty looks, angry gestures and nasty comments from all of them. I waited until arriving home to cool down before informing American Airlines of the horrible treatment and the attitude of these employees who clearly did not give a damn about me or anyone else.

They offered a comfortable aircraft for a long haul, beautiful and attentive staff, and good food. I then took these American Airlines flights. A new Boeing 787 - it was like going on a cross country trip in a subcompact car. I'm 6' tall 215 lbs, I'm a larger man but hardly a giant. The seats were hard and narrow. I had an aisle seat and every time the crew moved past me they hit my (recently surgically repaired) shoulder. I promise I wasn't sticking it out in the aisle. There was no one in the middle seat so my left leg got a break but my right knee (with the seat reclined, which is essential) was jammed into the armrest in front of me. This aircraft with these seats should not be flying 11 hour routes. Not to mention the tired, older staff (maybe they didn't see my shoulder?). Lousy food and service. I'm done with American Airlines and their AA rewards scam. I have flown internationally only a few times but this experience definitely stood out.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-01-30;" |  I am basically aghast at the treatment we received. Travel is difficult for me because of multiple back surgeries so I purchase first-class tickets for long flights. This itinerary was Phoenix to Medellin return via Miami. On the segment from Miami to Medellin there are only two rows of first-class seats. In order to squeeze in another coach row, American put in a divider between first class and coach immediately behind the second row of first class seats. Thus, both on the segment from Miami to Medellin and Medellin to Miami our 1st class purchased seats would not and could not recline. The stewardesses basically begged us to write a letter to American about this. On the tarmac in Miami we heard rumblings about not enough room for the luggage. When we arrived in Medellin, our first class priority tag luggage was not on the plane. Nor was the luggage for at least 20% of the plane. There had not been room in the luggage hold, which I assume means they took on cargo in preference to passengers' luggage who were flying on that plane. Since there is only one flight a day American would not get our luggage to Medellin until 9:30 PM the following night. They would not deliver our luggage to us at night. Thus, in order to catch our internal connection at 5:30 AM the following morning we had to drive approximately one hour each way. We arrived at 9:30 PM and were kept waiting in the hall until 10:30 PM as they would not give us our luggage until all the passengers on the flight just landed had disembarked and claim their luggage. I contacted American Airlines. They never formally accepted responsibility nor took me seriously. The compensation they offered, I assume to get us off their back, was significantly less than you would offer a traveler who was bumped. This is in spite of the fact that we have been very frequent users of American Airlines and had their credit card for over 30 years. This was an amazing experience at alienating loyal customers. Our entire family will not use American in the future if at all humanly possible.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2017-01-30;" |  In carefully reviewing my options to return from Mexico City, I specifically chose a flight on American Airlines that would arrive in the evening at 7:07pm, even though the cost of the ticket was $30 more for two reasons: I didn't want to be in the airport at midnight and #2 I felt that this airline was a more reliable airline than the smaller less well-known airline options. On the day of my flight, January 26, 2016 I received a couple of e-mails letting me know that my flight had been delayed, first by approximately an hour and then by 1 1/2 hours. I was advised, however, to arrive at the normal time because the airline was doing everything possible so that the flight would depart at the regularly scheduled time of 4:40pm. When I arrived at the airport, no one was able to find my reservation and I realized that my flight had been cancelled altogether. I had to find an alternate flight. I ended up on an alternate flight with a different airline, arriving in LAX at 11:30pm, exactly what I had attempted to avoid. I ended up paying the higher price without the convenience of decent flying times. Next time I will go for a cheaper, smaller airline. At least if it is postponed or cancelled, I won't be paying the higher price for a benefit that I never receive. I was surprised and disappointed at this unexpected occurrence. I don't have a boarding pass to show for the airline I am reviewing because obviously I ultimately flew on a different airline.  I am basically rating the inconvenience that their last minute change had on my schedule, the cost and the number of hours wasted in the airport looking for a resolution to the problem.";NEGATIVE

My seat was right in the middle of middle row. I was experiencing very bad nausea and vomiting at that time so I asked one of flight attendant to change my seat to the side so I wouldn't have to bother the person sitting next to me to get up over and over again. There were 3 seats empty behind us. I asked her if I could sit there, it was closest to the bathroom too. She said no, even though those are empty seats, you're not allowed to sit there. So pretty much they'd rather leave those empty than give it to a pregnant woman. Nice job American. She told me once everyone was seated, she would find me a side seat closest to the bathroom. I said ok. So I waited and she came back and told me there are two seats available and were closest to the bathroom. I moved there and there was 1 person sitting at the other end. Luckily, he moved with his friend and I got 3 seats to myself. Being tired and fatigued, I pretty much slept throughout the whole flight. I missed the dinner. When I woke up, one of the flight attendant noticed that I was one of the passengers who hadn't eaten, however she did not care to ask if I wanted anything. I got a glass of water and went to sleep again. When I woke up, I went to the bathroom and when I came back I asked the flight attendant if I could have a food tray, she gave me a very rude look and left. She came back after 15 minutes with the tray. I will not recommend or fly with American Airlines again. Our captain made an announcement that the in-flight entertainment system was out so we had no entertainment while flying from London to Chicago which was a 9 hour and 35 minute flight.

This was only communicated to us after we were at the airport and were given several updates of the flight status. The American Airlines manager falsely secured hotel rooms at a local hotel that had no availability. He issued taxi vouchers to the hotel and when the taxi company found out that he was sending people to the hotel that had no vacancies, they communicated this to rest of the stranded passengers trying to find lodging. The manager would not even come down to baggage claim to address the situation with everyone who was trying to find lodging for the night. I was finally able to find lodging at a nearby Marriott and only due to my platinum status were they able to find me a room. My family and I finally arrived at our hotel at 2am and were exhausted and stressed out to no end. I was able to work with my travel agent and have American Airlines get us on a United flight the next day which was amazing. The American Airlines plane that we flew on from Dallas to Honolulu was very antiquated and did not have screens or USBs compared to the state of the art plane that we flew on with United to Chicago. Upon my return I was instructed to contact American Airlines customer service for reimbursement for our hotel, taxi, meals etc. Some of the AA customer service were very helpful, but the last representative would not allow me to speak with a supervisor or have a supervisor contact me to discuss complete reimbursement for my hotel. She told me that I would have to accept AA's contracted rate for a hotel regardless of my situation and stated that they offered my family $200 vouchers to use on a future AA flight. I told her that vouchers do not compensate me for expenses incurred by a hotel that I was required to secure due to their flight cancellation. All I can say is the cancellation is one thing, how they handled the cancellation is another story and the reimbursement for insult and injury is truly another chapter. Suffice to say for a difference of $300 which is what it would have required to compensate me completely, they have not only lost 4 customers, they have potentially lost many more after I share my experience.

The passengers were stuck in the cabin for 30+ minutes and a large number of us missed our connecting flights. We were told to sort amongst ourselves about who had flights coming up sooner than others. Chaos broke out and, meanwhile, a flight attendant nearby was making a personal call to her bank and was of no help in a time of need and couldn't be bothered to be flagged down. My next flight was delayed for weather issues (which I know we can't control-gave an obvious pass here), but was then delayed for yet another mechanical problem (twice in one day AA-really?). Again, I was confined to the cabin for another 60+ minutes total.

I was on vacation and found out I needed to head home to Canada ASAP just two days before intended departure (mind you, this was New Year's Eve). I looked all over the web looking for tickets with many different airlines and agencies and found nothing but economy tickets at prices typical of first class. American Airlines also were full of ridiculously overpriced last minute seats, that is except for one route through PHL and BOS which were almost fully booked and therefore was a dirt cheap ticket even compared to normal season tickets. I jumped on the opportunity and booked my tickets via PayPal, which made everything much faster and simpler. Upon getting to the airport I realized I needed to buy a tag for my duffle bag in order to get it checked... not the most enticing thing but it was a fast process through the machine and was taken care of within a matter of seconds. Upon boarding, I was not expecting much, granted, this flight was American Eagle and they are not exactly renowned for premium service. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of comfort the seat had, and the flight attendants were in a good mood as well. Complimentary service on the flights were the same, a bag of pretzels and drinks, but who needs more than that on a flight that's 1.5 hrs long? I might also add that having my connecting gate exactly next to my arriving gate in PHL was a very rare and warm surprise. Gate attendants were friendly and cheerful, and seemed to be level with what they were doing. In summary, American is by no means a high-class airline to me, but I guess I was lucky in having been under the care of some really great people and it was well worth the low cost of the ticket. In the future, American will definitely be on my radar if I need a cheap last minute deal fast!";POSITIVE

They were basically yelling at passengers to sit down, and they were condescending about the most routine of things. Besides the horrendous attendants, the plane was so crammed.

I do understand when it comes to weather issues. in fact, I am grateful that they weren't hesitant to make customer safety first.

Everyone had already boarded on the plane, and halfway into the runway, the plane decided to turn back and redo a checkup. From which they decided to cancel the flight for the night and try again 23 hours later. How was it that they detected the problem only right before we were about to set off?

Fare was on offer so I flew American Business class to the US and British Airways First Class back to the UK. Checking in - Heathrow airport I arrived at 05.30, the check in desks did not open until 06.00 for an 08.40 flight. I was aware of the desk opening times so waiting was not a problem. There was a dedicated check in desk for business passengers and when I arrived there was only one other couple in front of me. Check in quick and efficient. No problems encountered. As I was flying business class I was informed that I could use the fast track security lane and make use of the American Airlines lounge. Boarding as with all major airlines boarding was the usual, Family's with children, Passengers that require help / more time followed by business class. On boarding I was direct to my seat and once seated asked if I would like a drink, went for Champagne (very nice too). Flight attendants very attentive, refilling my glass when it became empty. Inflight entertainment, for business class passengers on the 767 you are given a Samsung tablet and Bose headphones. Great choice of films & TV on the tablet only minor niggle is that the tablet is taken back about an hour before landing so a bit annoying if you are halfway through a decent film, also I am not sure how passengers who do not use tablets would of managed. Seat - I found the seat comfortable enough, plenty of leg room. As this was a morning flight I did not feel the need to make use of the lie flat feature so I cannot comment. The seat is controlled via a touch panel and it seems a bit sensitive as while resting my arm on the side the seat started to change position, I did this a couple of times until I placed something over the panel to prevent me from altering my seat layout accidently.

The check in was an unnecessarily stressful and upsetting experience caused by the unprofessionalism and aggression of American Airlines ground staff. After 30 minutes waiting in line the ground crew member informed those of us waiting there that the five desk staff were finishing their shift and we had to leave the line. Despite protests from my fellow passengers the woman informed us the staff would “up and leave” when their shift was finished. I am sympathetic that their shift was over but surely it would have been more effective to allow those of us waiting to check in or be served by other desk staff. I have never seen staff upping and leaving when there is a long line of people waiting without making sure they were to be attended to. I was then instructed to join the general enquiry line. In this line were people who had missed connections, missed flights, rebooking flights, unable to check in manually, oversized baggage, etc. The staff appeared to be directing people to lines in order to be rid of them and did not allow questions to be finished nor addressing passengers’ issues. Just a simple “go stand in that line”. The complaints from my fellow passengers echoed my own disbelief that at one point less than five desk staff were there to serve the long line of people and there was no coordination of passengers who had little time until boarding. I tried in vain to ask if another check-in option was available - highlighting my fear I would miss my connecting flight to London if I missed the domestic flight - but was continually dismissed. After two hours of waiting I was finally able to check in my luggage and thanks to the security staff allowing me to fast track through security I made the flight. It should not take 2.5 hours to check in one small bag!";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2017-01-10;" | I've often heard that American Airlines is bad from reading reviews, but after my most recent trip from San Francisco to Tokyo through Los Angeles and back, I can confidently say that I will not book a flight with AA again, ever. My trip to and fro were full of issues. I chose a morning flight at 7am since the ticket was cheaper, and and got to SFO at 5am, while thinking that I was giving myself ample time before departure. I was badly mistaken. When I got there, I saw a long line of more than 40 people queuing. The American Airlines check-in staff were rude and unsympathetically telling people in the queue who have missed their 6am flight that there's nothing they can't do about it, although the problems were due to their slow service. When checking in using the self check-in kiosk, I had problems scanning my passport, the kiosk asked me to verify my travel documents despite my having an Indonesian passport and traveling to Indonesia, and it ran out of paper to print my luggage tags. Many of the check-in kiosks were unresponsive and no one was there to fix it. IFE was the only decent thing they had, their screens are surprisingly capacitive, which allows much better interaction with your fingers. Inflight cabin attendants were impolite. My return flight wasn't a better experience. Upon arriving at LAX after a 7-hour and 9-hour flight, I was told that my LAX to SFO flight was canceled and of course there's nothing American Airlines can do about it besides rebooking my flight to the next day (which they can't even do automatically), and I didn't like that since I have to get back to work the next day. I had to drive back from LA to SF after my 20 hour trip, while jet-lagged. Seriously, avoid American Airlines like the plague. Also, lesson learned, try to avoid flights that have domestic transits.";NEGATIVE

I have my medication in that luggage and now I have to go out of my way to purchase more. Amercian Airlines doesn't even provide any compensation for these sort of mistakes.

We were scheduled to return to Richmond from College Station via American Airlines on January 6, 2017. We purchased our tickets from Orbitz. When we went to the Amercian Airlines ticket counter on January 6 to get our boarding passes for return flight from College Station on Amerian Airline Flight 2803 leaving at 10:35 AM, the American Airline Agent told us that our return tickets were cancelled by Orbitz perhaps by error and hence she would be unable to give us boarding passes. It was a real surprise to us! The plane was about to leave in less than an hour. I frantically called Orbitz and they expressed apology and tried to fix the problem. The first agent at Orbitz could not solve the problem and then passed the call to his supervisors and after being on the phone for more than two hours, Orbitz finally was able to reinstated our tickets in American Airline System. By the time our scheduled flight left the airport and our connecting flight from Dallas to Richmond got sold out. Orbitz suggested that we buy two new one way tickets for later flight and they would reimburse us. There was no guarantee that we will ever get reimbursed based on verbal commitment by Orbitz. So we got quite concerned. We went back to the AA agent and she understood our dilemma, she watched us talking to Orbitz for two hours to resolve the issue. She went back on her own and talked to her supervisor while I was on the phone with Orbitz. She came back to tell us that she would try to switch our reinstated tickets to a later flight from CLL to RIC via DFW. She worked on her computer for a while and finally managed to put us on a later flight. My wife and I were overwhelmed by the extraordinary help extended to us. We had to return back to Richmond on January 6. Without the agents help we would have been stranded and we are extremely grateful to her for her assistance. She is most gracious and courteous and helpful. We thank her most sincerely. ";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2017-01-06;" |  Flying with American Airlines from Miami to La Guardia, New York has been the most frustrating and disappointing experience I have ever had traveling. The staff are rude and uneducated and they have many staff members who only speak one language (which makes it really difficult to communicate). I arrived late to my flight in Miami because I was on a previous flight that we missed due to bad weather. When I get to Miami I had about an hour to get everything done but with the lack of education and common sense from the staff members at American Airlines I was cut short on time. First off in my previous flight I was given a standby ticket for this flight because we were not going to make it to our original flight. When I get to Miami and tried explaining that to the staff member in bag check in she told me ""keep your mouth shut and give me your ticket"". She then tells me I'm too late to check in my bags so I decide not to go with bags. The women gave me back my stand by ticket instead of boarding pass which did not allow me to go to TSA. I then had to go back in the line to get a boarding pass. Finally got a boarding pass and TSA were excellent and let us go ahead of everyone so we could make the flight. When I get to the gate the ""manager"" told me I was not able to get on board because the doors were closed. It was 8.20 and the flight got delayed to 8.40. If I'm not mistaken you can board up to 10 minutes prior to flying. She refused to let us on and decided that her best customer service skill was to scream at us. An elderly disabled women caused a scene at the gate, and she was allowed to board. I refuse to take another flight with American Airlines. ";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2017-01-06;" | I bought my ticket via British Airways and 2 of the 5 sectors were with American Airlines. I had thought since I'd bought a full service ticket all the flights would be with full service airlines and not mixed with a budget airline. I am writing to BA to complain - even though the 3 sectors flying with BA were wonderful. My first flight with AA was Las Vegas to London via Chicago. I had no money on me and my cards were in my hand luggage as I didn't think they were needed. These were put in the hold anyway as there was no space in the lockers, but I did not know AA was a budget airline and the whole ""money, money, money is everything"". I got a ""free"" glass of water and went hungry. I then had a tight connection at ORD so had to get straight to the next gate (it said free soft drink is back with much fanfare, so yes, they must have tried to remove even that). I was pleased to see a new aircraft, but it ended there. The staff were such a mixed bunch, never seen a flight crew like it, it was almost as if they were volunteers. Anyway, they were nice enough, a million miles from a full service airline but reckon they gave all they could with their working conditions. Anyway my whole reason for writing this review is because of the food. Now I could feel the resentment from American Airlines. How dare they have to give free food out. What a shame so much of the transatlantic competitors do. I say free, of course it's in the ticket price but they call it complimentary. So by this point I'm starving and my kosher meal came. It blew my mind. One stale bun, crumbled in my hands. No butter or even spread, you'll have it dry. A side of sour shredded veg. I don't know, it was like coleslaw with no mayo and sat in vinegar for days on end until it wilted. Must have been the cheapest thing the catering firm had, it was beyond vile. Simply not edible. The teeny ""main"" was beyond it as well, little drops of pasta that were so overcooked it liquefied upon contact with tongue and tasted of nothing. Just unbelievable. The BBQ ""chicken"" was highly processed, bland and a perfect partner for the horror of it all. Maybe 5,000 flights, this was the most pathetic assortment of rubbish I'd ever been given. Then there was a tiny square of sponge with jam and coconut. I can't eat coconut but hey, the whole thing was vile. For ""breakfast"" the offering was so ridiculous I kindly asked the attendant to take it back. I had hoped for a full English, but thought I might get a warmed 7 day croissant, but no, it was a stale bun with no butter. The mainstream offering was a bag of dried cranberries which I can't eat, a mixed berry slice of muffin (don't expect a full muffin!). It doesn't sound so horrific, just cheap, but I can't eat dried fruit. I did eat the yogurt which American couldn't mess up. I left the first plane ravenous and the second chewing my knuckles. There were only two drinks served over the 7 hours of course. Paid a full service price and fobbed me off with this. They need to disassociate with that brand immediately.";NEGATIVE

Almost every agent, flight attendant, and other airline staff were inefficient, disgruntled, or rude.  I would never recommend this airline. On flight out we had a super old plane that was making all kinds of weird/loud noises. We were on the same plane out of Phoenix and they wouldn't take off with the noise so we returned to the gate and sat for over an hour and a half with no information on what was wrong (just the repeated ""technical issue"" update at about 15 mins intervals and no cabin service). The plane was completely powered off at one point which meant no lights/air for a period of time. When we finally made it to Tampa the power also went off as we were trying to de-board. Fast forward to the return flight and after waiting in a super long line, the curbside check-in didn't work and they wouldn't tell us why. Had to wait in another line to check our stroller inside and the agent there was convinced we were traveling to San Francisco, Costa Rica, not CA. Printed off boarding passes for Tampa and Phoenix in a horrible jumble which we were forced to sort ourselves at security with (at this point) screaming children in tow. Barely made the flight and we were at the airport almost 2 hours in advance. In Phoenix we discovered for some reason our boarding passes no longer had priority on them but group two. I had to wait at the counter for at least 15 mins (children now screaming again) while the agent completely ignored me, and when I was finally able to ask if we could board with priority as we had on every other leg I was very rudely interrupted as the agent said repeatedly, ""what's written on your boarding pass, what's written on your boarding pass?"" We were in the back of the plane that leg - with a four-year old and two-year old. Boarding in group 2 was an absolute nightmare and we held up a bunch of other people. We are also (or I should say were as of today) platinum card holders, but because my father booked the trip for us that didn't matter. At least the plane was newer on that leg, but super bare-bones for the age. Couldn't get the in-flight streaming option to work either (they only support for a limited number of browsers). I have never felt compelled to write an airline review before, but given this experience I felt compelled to warn future travelers (especially those with young children) that this is not the airline for you.";NEGATIVE

We departed on time and about 3.5 hours into a 5 hour flight the pilot announced that American Airlines had made a decision not to land in Vail do to a winter snow storm. Our plane was completely full of people heading for a ski trip. The incredible decision by AA to head back to Miami was crazy. No chance to deviate to Dallas or even Denver that was open. The entire plane was extremely upset on the poor choice and way of communication, with no regards for the huge investment on our vacation. Upon arrival back in Miami the entire plane, about several 100 people weren't assisted in any way by AA. After waiting almost an hour, they advised us to head to gate D37 a rebooking center, a nightmare of several hours that did not help. We ended up on a flight out of Miami to Charllotte that evening to head into Denver the next morning. We lost that night stay at our hotel in Vail, our lift ticket the following day and ski rental. AA gave us zero vouchers, with huge additional costs to my family. We had to pay for hotel in Charlotte and dinner at airport. ";NEGATIVE

After an hour, we headed to the gate where we were told we were downgraded because they sold 20 first class tickets for 16 seats. Since we bought ours in March, they cost the least, therefore, we were downgraded. Here's a center seat and a $300 voucher, no drink voucher, no systemwide upgrade, but a promise of we'll provide you your drinks and meals onboard. I doubt they will.

american-airlines;2016-12-30;" |  Tokyo to Mexico City via Los Angeles. The inflight service was terrible. bad food, small servings, irresponsive crews, overcrowded lavatories, smaller aisle. This was all bearable until I reached Los Angeles for my 14 hours layover for my flight to Mexico city. The flight was suppose to depart at 23:55 at first, then delays of 20, 50, 120 minutes was announced until the flight was announced cancelled. Along with 6 other flights in LAX, American Airlines cancelled these flights altogether creating a mayhem in LAX. The airline has a customer service counter with 2 desks, just 2! And any other AA personnel you see in the airport are unwilling to answer any questions and they try to direct you to the service counter. When 7 flights are cancelled at one time, the queues to the counter are long, I mean 7-Hours long in the end. After getting reneged on your contract with AA to fly to your destination, you are forced to wait 7-hours to get an answer. So I did exactly that, and only then I knew it was because they had poor crew scheduling, resulting in insufficient crews to provide those flights. How is that even possible? With poor regulations of airline policies in the US, these airlines and airports are falling way behind with competitions from Middle East and Asia. So at the counter, I asked what do you have for me? The nonchalant service crew wasn't unsympathetic about our situation and just offered a replacement flight 3-days later - 3 days, 72-hours and told me there is nothing else they can do about it. Since I have my activities booked in Mexico city already, i have to pay a last-minute ticket to the city on my own which cost me $600 USD. American Airlines are unwilling to do anything about it and just asked me to collect my ""checked"" luggage which is left somewhere in the airport, without anyone overseeing it. To be honest, I read reviews about AA before buying the flight but did not know it can be this terrible.  To all future travellers contemplating about the savings you get taking American Airlines - don't do it, pay more to get a decent airline.";NEGATIVE

Next we were told no overheard space for carry ons was left and had to check our carry ons and pick them up at baggage claim. Also ridiculous. AA knows exactly how many people and bags they have - they only run out of space by letting people fill overhead bins with jackets etc. Irresponsible. I would try hard never to fly with these unhappy employees nor this third rate airline. On a humanistic note: there was a Spanish speaking woman in line next to us who was repeatedly dismissed and sent to the back of the line because no one would bother to call one of the many bilingual employees to assist her.

Only problem is there wasn't a single agent at any of the desks, including customer service. I finally found an agent behind the Cuba desk and she told me I couldn't switch baggage in domestic flights. So I booked a reservation, paid a fee under the impression by baggage could arrive with me because of contradictory beliefs on a basic, fundamental policy, which should have been explained before I booked my new flight. I called customer service and they said they would not refund me the baggage fee for the inconvenience of coming back to the airport at 1AM to pick up my luggage. She told me to find a different agent and see what could be done. When I found another agent she was on the phone speaking to a friend in Spanish and popping her gum, ignored me for three minutes, then told me to have a seat and be patient for the agent who will arrive in 30 minutes.

First, their plane was late arriving at the airport so they could get on it in the first place. Then their flight from DFW to SAT was cancelled, but the airline staff did not announce that, instead they kept leading everyone on as if the plane would be ready at any minute. Their plane, finally ""ready"" at 0700 the next morning, was fully loaded and ready for take off. Until the crew discovered the brakes weren't working. Back to the gate and off the plane they go.

american-airlines;2016-12-18;"New York JFK to Akron–Canton via Charlotte. Over the past two months I have been traveling through Europe and taken countless flights, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. To begin with, the boarding procedure was delayed because the previous flight arrived late. After getting the plane ready the crew boarded us about 30 minutes after our original boarding time. Everyone got on the aircraft and sat and waited for a long time before being told they were experiencing mechanical issues and they were bringing people in to check out the situation. We sat and waited and then were finally told that if we would like to get off the plane we were welcome to. I proceeded to leave the plane to speak with an agent because I knew that I was going to miss my connecting flight in CLT. There was one travel agent available for a whole airplane of people and she seemed to care less about helping us because her shift was supposed to be ending. I asked if I could change my end destination to a larger airport that was within 300 miles of my original end point and I was told no. The only option they could give me was a flight out the next day. I took the new flight information and proceeded to call the service number where I was told the exact opposite information that the travel agent at the airport told me. However, there is nothing that the agents over the phone can do because they cannot physically give you a new boarding pass or vouchers to make up for the inconvenience. By the time I was about to get back in line to speak with the travel agent in person and inform her of what I was told on the phone, there was a line of about 20 people. I went back to the gate and was told to re-board the plane if we had new boarding passes and had been situated on a new flight out of CLT. I got back on the plane and sat for all of five minutes to be told that their flight crew had timed out and a new crew would not arrive for at least another hour. We once again had to exit the plane and go sit by the gate. They did provide us some snacks while we waited and the crew did not arrive until 2 hours later. There was still only one travel agent available to assist passengers who needed to re-book their flights and the customer support agents were impatient, rude, and acted as though this was our problem and not their own. I do not remember hearing the words ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"" once out of anybody. After sitting until 1:00am they finally had a crew and boarded us for a third time on the plane. It took forever to take off and we landed in CLT at about 3:30am. We were told we would receive hotel vouchers, transportation, and food once in CLT. Clearly JFK did not communicate the issues to CLT because the members in Charlotte had no idea what was going on and we had to wait another hour for a supervisor to come out and speak to us. At this point, there was no point in getting a hotel voucher because flights would be leaving within a few hours. I finally spoke with an agent who put me on an earlier flight to a different airport that was close to my original destination. He also provided me with a food voucher. This was the first time that I received answers and was helped in a caring and apologetic way. This was also the first time that I was not quickly shut down and told no. I finally made it home after many hours, many tears, and lots of frustration. The lack of support and concern for their passengers is ridiculous and I will never fly AA again.";NEGATIVE

Our flight was meant to leave at 530 am and due to icy weather conditions, we were delayed 6 hours. Although the staff were kind, we ended up waiting on the aircraft for hours with little to no information. When we finally took off, about an hour into the flight the pilot informed us that due to a mechanical malfunction we would have to make an emergency landing in Jacksonville (intended destination = Miami.) Again captain and crew were great - no complaints. Once we landed, we were told very little about the prognosis of our aircraft and we ended up having to wait in a huge group of 160 people as we learned very slowly that the flight could not be officially cancelled until they were certain they couldn't find a replacement captain and crew, but also couldn't help us rebook a new flight to make connections. Thus, this all resulted in zero contingency plan and lots of unnecessary waiting. When we finally departed for Miami at 1030 pm on the original aircraft with a new captain and crew, we were promised hotel and transportation vouchers upon our arrival in MIA. However when we arrived, the line to receive these vouchers was hundreds of people long with no end in sight. I (along with hundreds of other passengers) were extremely disappointed with the lack of organization or a streamlined process.";NEGATIVE

The interesting part of this was, we only walked up to the kiosk to ask them if it was a possibility to upgrade our seats. We weren't expecting it, only asking if it was a possibility. Interestingly enough, the American Airlines attendant told us there was not point in talking to them unless we did it 24 hours in advanced. I don't care about that. I just wanted to ask.

As I am aware some American Airlines planes are very old I usually try to book a flight operated by some newish Boeing 737-800 which are very common on this route: this year I wanted to fly business class (they call it First but it's just a trick) so I had limited options for ny reward ticket and I ended up in a 4:40pm flight. They changed the plane to a B757 a few weeks after my booking so in the end my flight was operated by a glorious aircraft from the '80s with extremely wide but hard seats with limited recline capability. Because of a technical issue, departure was delayed for about one hour (this happened in about 40% of all the flights I had with AA so far, kind of disturbing if you compare with other major airlines) but no big deal as I was not in a hurry. No PTV on the seat just the old fashioned hanging monitor with terrible sound and video quality, so bad they even had to interrupt the safety video because it was a torture for our ears. Flight was uneventful with a pleasant purser who greeted passengers one by one by shaking their hands both upon boarding and before landing. I did not feel like eating so did not try the meal which did look fine by the way (chicken with some vegetables). The one and only positive thing about this trip was I paid 5USD: not sure I will repeat the experience though, unless I am absolutely sure I can fly on a more recent aircraft with better and modern features.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2016-12-13;" |  I was flying MIA to LHR via JFK with American Airlines. This review is for the MIA-JFK route. I was originally booked onto a 757, international configuration with angled lie flat seats. However I took the opportunity to do a same day flight change and get an earlier flight, this would enable me to do a quick bit of shopping. Additionally the change of flight allowed me to sample a reconfigured 767, with the lie flat seats. I arrived at MIA at 6.45am for my 9.26am departure. There was no queue for the Priority check-in and I just needed to pick up my boarding passes as I was hand bag only. The check-in associate was friendly and helpful. I had access to fast track security and I was through in 5 minutes. I used the Admirals Club at Gate 30. It was a pretty pathetic offering, unlike the AA First class lounge at JFK which is excellent. The AC had a very limited free breakfast offering and I had a bagel and coffee. I was provided with a single drinks voucher which I used to get a bottle of water for the flight. Boarding commenced on time at precisely 8.56am - 30 minutes before departure. After people with access needs boarded, First class passengers were invited to board. On boarding a FA offered to hang my coat and I was offered a pre departure drink and I selected coffee. On international legs, a Samsung tablet is provided, but only main screen entertainment was offered on this short 2.5 hour flight. I was provided with in ear headphones. The seat was excellent, fully flat with plenty of space. I was seated in 6D, I would have preferred a window but none where available at checkin. I would have been happy with this seat on an international sector, so felt spoilt for a short domestic flight. The FA who looked after me was great, friendly, attentive and address me by my name. Cereal or a three cheese omelette were on offer. I chose the latter which was definitely the most popular choice. The omelette and the sausage provided were not great, but the side veggies and biscuit were excellent. After eating I promptly fell asleep for the remainder of the flight. Overall besides the poor lounge offering, this was an excellent domestic flight.";POSITIVE

American Airlines stewardess told me to leave my carry on bag because it was too big even though I saw passengers in front of me passing with no problems with carry on bags far bigger than mine. The rest of the flight was just same, unfriendly and careless. At the end of our flight we were offered to buy American Airlines point cards.

You also cannot pay extra to upgrade to a seat with extra leg room.

Monday 8:00 PM departure on November 22nd from JFK to Tucson, immediate announcement from the cockpit that we could expect air turbulence and the seat belt sign would remain on the entire flight. We encountered three or four slight bumps mid flight, that was it totally smooth flying. Since the seat belt sign was pre determined to stay on it gave the entire plane, except first class no cabin service on the five plus hour flight. The other major uncomfortable problem was the cabin temperature was around 80 degrees and yet there was no one to ask about getting air turned down. No one approached any of the passengers on this five plus hour flight. I arrived Tucson soaked with sweat and dehydrated from no fluid. The first thing I did the next day was cancel the future flights I had booked on American. I realize the airline is working hard to make a comeback, they still have a lot of problems and created a very unpleasant flight back from a long weekend in NYC.

Inflight staff and staff in both airports were extremely rude and snobby, always looking down on you. Generally quite unprofessional.

We were delayed by 2 hours due to a technical issue and there was no update from the captain on whether or not we would make up the time. Check in and airport staff in JFK need to learn some customer service skills. No smiling, rude people that generally look fed up in life and with their job. They sigh, they roll their eyes.

Amazing that 6 hours before my flight and before the plane has left its initial city that it was delayed. I called American Airlines and they changed me to the 11:45am flight to DFW - all good.

Great. We get there and wait for 2 hours - being told its taking that much time to move our catering and luggage over from one plane to the other - just a few gates away. After 90 minutes they brought chips and drinks which was nice. And they were re-routing people with connections as in the end it was over a 2+ hour delay on arriving into Paris. The inflight service was excellent - they were apologetic about the delay and the FA serving my aisle was funny and considerate. But again - nothing from American Airlines once I landed. With Delta - you have such a delay you check your email and you have an apology and 10,000 points in your account. Proactive - great policy. American? Nothing. No email. No offer. Just deal with it. So I complained online and they sent me 7,500 miles and an apology. I appreciate it but it also doesn't make up for the Euro 166 I had to pay for my new train ticket from Paris to Amsterdam that I missed due to the flight delay.

First of all, of the three legs, two of the planes had mechanical issues which led in one case to have to switch planes and the other to sit on the tarmac for an hour. The longest flight was from Miami to Lima on a 767. It looked and felt old and worn out. The seats were pure punishment. They were not the new ""slim line"" seats, but were worn to the point of being hard. The legroom was poor, and I'm only 5'6"". I can't imaging what a six foot tall person had to endure. There was no in seat entertainment, just the drop down screens in various locations.

American could do it for an increase of $7,500! They said the flights were full, and we would have to fly business class.

All 3 stewardesses spent the last 20 minutes of flight complaining about an economy customer in front of everyone in first class. The experience was poor. Go Southwest or Delta because American Airlines employees are angry and take it out on customers.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-11-17;Washington Reagan to Dallas/Fort Worth. The A321 aircraft appeared to be new. Our seats in first class were comfortable with acceptable legroom. The first class cabin was very clean and inviting. Very nice service by the staff and the lunch (a cooked Italian pasta dish and salad ) was not bad. The red wine was OK as well. But where this flight really shined concerned the very impressive inflight entertainment (IFE) system featuring a huge number of video and audio selections as well as an upgraded map display with a number of different views of our flight in progress available. This was the best domestic IFE I have ever experienced.;POSITIVE

The flight attendants were extremely rude to both my wife and myself. We finally got to LAX and had to wait to get off the plane because a group of Chinese tourists needed to get to the International terminal. We were then shepherded into an office where we stood for 2 hours - our plane had already left the airport before we arrived to which no one told us because getting the other people off was much more important. When we finally got to the main counter we were told that the only plane we could get was at 11.35pm that night - it was only 9am. We tried to negotiate to get another airline or even a hotel and catch the direct plane the next morning but we were told if we wanted to do any of that it would be at our own cost. We stayed in LAX and when I got home I sent an email to American Airlines and they sent me a $100 voucher for my next flight with them.;NEGATIVE

American Airlines put me on the next flight available which was a 6:30 connecting flight to Chicago. I got to Nashville after 10:00 pm and missed the reunion party. However, they did give me a $200 voucher to fly again. When I attempted to use the voucher on my next flight, I was told that voucher only has 14 digits. We only accept 19 digit vouchers.

On the day of the burial the church services and burial were running behind schedule. We immediately contacted American Airlines and explained that we were attending the burial and that we would not be able to make our original flight which was scheduled for 1:29 pm. We were promptly taken care of and placed on the 5:15 pm flight for a mere $75 per person extra. Where is your heart American? This was clearly an emergency and we had paperwork to substantiate our position. At the very least you could have waived the fees!! Anyway, we get to the airport and are waiting at the gate to be boarded. I've never seen such chaos!! Normally people are boarded from the back of the plane to the front, after boarding ""Priority"" passengers first. After calling for Priority passengers, the chaos began. They never called us by section and people were being boarded in a disorderly fashion. The best part was after half the people had boarded already they decided to stop the rest of us and have us check in our carry-on luggage if they had wheels on them. Who the heck has carry-on luggage without wheels these days? That added extra time and aggravation to this flight. To add insult to injury we were subjected to the most uncomfortable seats and worst snacks.  We will never fly American Airlines again - they are insensitive and disorganized!";NEGATIVE

Flight departed slightly late and arrived with a slight delay, but a great onboard experience. Friendly flight attendants as well (was given a free set of headphones) and excellent IFE (good choice of movies). Much better than the Boeing 737 that American flies to SFO from MIA.

american-airlines;2016-11-10;" |  Dallas Ft Worth to Paris CDG, connecting to El Al for flight to Tel Aviv. After checking in approximately 3.5 hours prior to departure, which is ample time for international travel, and my bag being tagged as ""Priority,"" since Monday, November 7, no one can tell me with certainty where my luggage is. In CDG I was told that I needed to give the gate agents the code for my padlocks even though they are TSA approved. I complied with their request and gave them my code. Prior to arrival in Tel Aviv, I was advised by the flight attendant that my bag had not made it on the flight and to ensure that I would file a claim with El Al at the Lost Baggage counter prior to exiting the TLV airport, which I did. The agent there told me that there were two flights coming in later, and that my case would be on one of them. They gave me a bag with very basic toiletries and what looked like a short pyjama suited for my 10 year-old granddaughter. They told me that there was no allowance until after 24 hours. I was also asked to cross off from my declaration any items over $100 so I wouldn't need to return to the airport to pay duty on those items. I questioned the accuracy of her statement, but the agent who filed my claim with El Al insisted that I had to cross off on my form what I had begun to list as items over $100 in value, which I did. That was Tuesday, November 8. On Wednesday, November 9, the hotel concierge followed up on my claim. The person he spoke with said for me to get whatever I needed and to keep all receipts. That evening the concierge followed up with El Al again, who informed us that my luggage was still in Dallas! I called back and spoke with Maya, who told me American Airlines had put my luggage on a flight to Toronto and then it was scheduled to get onto an Air Canada flight to Tel Aviv. ETA was now for Thursday morning. I am joining a Holy Land tour and had gone a few days ahead to spend visiting Jerusalem. Instead, I have been wasting my time trying to track my luggage.  A hotel guest relayed to the concierge and me that El Al had told her that if she wanted her luggage the day it had arrived, she would have to get a taxi to and fro the airport as their courier was no longer available, which she had no other choice but to do it. Armed with this information I hung tight by the hotel. On Thursday morning (I departed on Monday), the El Al call center for lost luggage would not put me through a manager as he was calling American Airlines liars. He said he would have a manager call me, which still has not happened. As of Thursday afternoon, American told my husband that they lost track of my luggage in Toronto and that they could not access El Al lost baggage system. El Al claims AA is lying as the lost luggage system is an international system, not El Al's. Until they physically have my case in their possession, El Al cannot do or say anything further. And besides being tagged ""Priority,"" they also have me as VIP in their system. I have lost the extra days in Israel. What promised to be a trip of a lifetime has become a nightmare for me.  It is ironic that my bag was so handled by American Airlines, compounded by El Al. I only have one word : disgraceful.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-11-09;" |  I've had my share of bad experiences with American Airlines including permanently lost luggage, misconnects, delays and rude customer service on the ground and in the air. I’ve tended to avoid them except for domestic US travel so approached this HKG-LAX flight with trepidation. The key attraction was a business class fare significantly lower than any other direct service on the route (and even cheaper than one-stops via Seoul or Taipei). Perhaps I was very impressed because my expectations were set so low. This was a very good flight. Same J class seat as CX, except AA provided a mattress and pyjamas. They served plated food of decent quality and quantity, had a decent wine list and a provided a wide selection of programming on the IFE so delivered on everything you should expect from a world class premium airline. Ultimately what made this flight very good was the crew. They appeared to be enjoying their jobs – lots of smiles and proactive interaction with the passengers. I could not fault any aspect of the service. I’m now willing to consider American Airlines for long haul business class travel if this is the level of service they can deliver consistently. Well done American.";POSITIVE

I went to baggage claim (out of secure area), waited for my bag, didn't find it, then was told it was being automatically transferred. I had to go back, through security.

I tried to check in online 90 minutes prior to departure three times with no success. I called customer service and asked them for assistance and they said you can only check in online and at the airport. I arrived to the ticket counter 30 minutes prior to my flight and she said this is odd, I can see you are on this flight but there are no seats. I asked how that could be. She even called a coworker over and they said all we can do is put you on standby for the next flight. I was pretty upset and proceeded through security to the gate arriving 15 minutes prior to departure time. I asked the girl at the gate counter why my seat was given away and she called a gentleman over and they whispered as they looked on the screen. She asked him if she should pull ""her"" from the plane. She then closed the door and locked it. He stood there as if I should just walk off gingerly. I debated with him about why their antics were bad business and his only come back was that I should have checked in earlier. I said like 90 minutes earlier like I tried to do. Not everyone can be at the gate 2 hours prior to a flight. This is 2016 - that's what technology is for which American Airlines is obviously struggling with. Not to mention customer service. I called customer service again, this time speaking to an agent who was nice but obviously thought her level of kindness was equaled by my ignorance. She put me on hold for a few minutes after hearing my story and has the audacity to come back and say I got you on the 8:15 flight. I asked the flight I'm already on after getting dumped on by your company? She said it's the least I can do. I said what about a refund or a voucher or waiving the $75 I had to pay for a flight you gave my seat away on which had I known was going to happen would have never changed to? She said I'm afraid I can't do anything sir. This is all comical now but being a business guy I can see huge inefficiencies in operations and customer service. So in all honesty I would not fly American Airlines. I know I won't. There are too many other options - companies who wouldn't treat their customers in this manner.";NEGATIVE

Two good natured flight attendants worked the cabin, smiling and pleasant despite grumpy passengers. Warm nuts, drinks, a full meal, and a warm cookie to top it off.

No sooner were we taxiing back to the gate without an explanation until 20 minutes later when we were told about electronic problem. On our flight which lasted over 7-hours we received a bag of stale mini pretzels. As we approached Phoenix airport we circled for 30 minutes without any updates from the captain. We then began to pick up speed and told we were headed to Palm Springs because there was not enough fuel to continue circling. We finally land at our diversion site in Palm Springs where we proceed to sit on the runway for an hour because there are no AA agents to assist us at a gate. Not once are we offered beverage or snack. After over an hour we finally depart back to Phoenix with again no regular updates from cockpit. Yes, customer service has taken a hit in the industry but AA takes the cake. They should be ashamed of their product. Also, absolutely terrible and spotty wifi. And no inflight entertainment on a cross country flight. 10 + hours later. Disgusting";NEGATIVE

Check-in was prompt, and I accessed the Admiral's Club Lounge due to my One World Emerald Tier membership with British Airways. Staff at DCA were efficient, and some quite friendly. Boarding and in-flight service was very good. Meal and beverage service was adequate for domestic First Class these days, and the aircraft was a newer Boeing 737-800 with leather seats and the sky interior lighting. Good safety demonstration video, and a smooth, on-time flight with good information from the crew. My bags needed to be re-checked at Cathay Pacific due to their flight being the following day, but LAX staff took a while to send them to the carousel. The only things I missed in-flight were a foot/leg rest in the seat, and the lack of a GIS flight map on the TV monitors. Overall, I was very satisfied with this flight. My return flight was via ORD to DCA 12 days later, and was comparable, despite the aircraft being an older Boeing 737-800 with the fabric interior.";POSITIVE

Once we checked at gate they kept telling us that we would be called up soon, again no mention of flight being overbooked. It was only after they had boarded the plane and I asked agent directly three times if we had a seat on the plane that she said ""doesn't look good"". She then finally admitted that the flight was overbooked. Per their stated overbooking policy, they are supposed to ask for volunteers which never happened. In this case the agents also seemed incompetent at counting because after we continued to complain she went on the plane to look and ""found"" 2 open seats. She then followed behind us screaming ""Run! Run!"" as we walked to board the plane. That part I found especially ridiculous as we had been waiting at the ticket counter for over an hour trying to sort this out and it was the agent who waited until the last minute to be truthful and act.

I fly 100,000+ miles a year with them. Are they perfect, no. But in my experience, you get out of it, what you put into it. Instead of looking for a problem or gripe, try making the best out of it.

Instead of putting the dog in its carrier, the woman petted the dog, and passed it back and forth to another passenger across the isle several times during the 5+ hour flight. One of the flight attendants even carried the dog up to the front of the plane so that the other attendants could pet it. The dog was not a service dog. I have severe allergies, I and several other passengers nearby began coughing and sneezing. When I mentioned to FA's that this was against AA's pet policy, they claimed to be unfamiliar with the policy. I have been on many, many flights with dogs and cats, and never once complained. With the exception of service dogs, which laid quietly on the floor, all other pets remained in their cases under the seat. I took allergy medicine and was able to manage my symptoms. This is the only flight I have ever been on where a pet has been allowed to be loose and to be handled in such a way. I contacted Customer Relations, expecting to have them apologize, and received a meaningless, copy-and-paste response. The response does not indicate in any way that they understand the  issue, recognize that their own policies were not followed, or have any intention of addressing the situation in any way. I tried calling customer service, but got referred back to Customer Relations, who can’t be bothered to provide a phone number. I contacted them over Twitter, but only got a token response.

You then have to walk up to a clerk who then weighs your bag, checks your ticket and ID all over again. Why do we have to do the same exact thing twice? Total waste of time. Once we were on the plane, we were excited to see that there were TVs with movies, tv shows, etc available. However, the pilot and attendants interrupt the screens whenever they speak over the microphone, and they play through your headphones at inexcusable volume. Each time they came over the loudspeaker, you could look around and everyone was ripping their earphones out of their ears. This was at least twice an hour on a 3 hour flight. On the 3 hour flight, you can have 1 drink but no snacks are provided. I know that flying isn't luxurious in economy class, but they make everything more annoying and complicated than needed. They have a video they play in the beginning of your flight that says ""we know you have a choice when you fly, so thank you for flying American Airlines"".

Next is what continues to frustrate me. American Airlines lost my luggage for the entire week I spent in New York - it was not until I got back to England that i received my bag. I had to call every night I was there to get any information on the current status of my bag, which was mostly mixed advice and nobody with any idea what was going on. Now, 2 months later I find myself having to call them every week to get anything done. I sent them all the receipts from my purchases. A month following this they agree to pay, it's been another month and they continue to spell my email address wrong, lose most of my correspondence and never do anything without a call. The amount of time I have spent on hold with AA could be measured in days. They are very openly making it as difficult as possible for me to get my money back in the hope I will give up. I have never had such a drawn out and consistently awful experience. I don't think anyone reads anything I send before they reply with something generic and unhelpful, then I call and have to guide them through their own job. As soon as I hang up they ignore me and my case once more. Don't risk flying with them, they don't care about their customers or reputation anymore.";NEGATIVE

Hopefully American learn something from my poor experience and use that to create a better experience for the next guy.  On Tuesday 4 October I knew the flight I was originally on for Thursday 6 October was going to get screwed up due to the impending hurricane so I tried to be proactive and call American. I was charged ~$720 to change the flight to Wednesday 5 October. My friend who was also on that same flight, waited until hours later to change his flight. Since a weather alert was issued, he was charged $0 to change his flight. Now you would think that American would be happy that I was proactive and allowed them to be organized, but when I called in and asked for a refund since I thought it was ridiculous that I was charged ~$720 for being proactive, my request naturally was rejected.  On Monday  10 October I was booked on flight AA68 leaving at 10:30am. The flight was delayed because there was an oil leak. The original flight was postponed to Tuesday 11 October, however we offered a free transfer to a different flight taking off at 3 pm (4.5 hours later). As a reparation, we were offered food that had already been expired (see picture 1). Finally after boarding the flight, I was given a seat with a defective television screen so I had to stare at a screen with inverted colors while the rest of my flight was able to enjoy a movie. Fortunately, this gave me plenty of time to think about what an awful job American has done on my last 3 flights. American Airlines has just come off of a record year making $7.6 billion dollars. The last two times I've worked with American I gave them roughly $2,000 worth of business. Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. Every single flight was delayed, I was fed expired food, I was charged over $700 to change a flight before a natural disaster that you allowed other clients to change for free.

We asked if we could be out I that flight but at every turn were told that it was against company policy and that such a change would cost $200 each. We realize what ""the policy"" is but were hoping in a rationale, customer focused world we could get on a flight with vacancies that was going directly to Albany rather than having to fly halfway across the country only to return to the east coast. Of course the rationale is that the direct flight ""might"" have cost less than the flight we booked. When I asked for a comparison of the costs of the 2 flights at the time we booked it the airline said there was no way they could tell. Even though many airlines look for every conceivable angle to make money off their customers it's a shame that American assumes the same pecuniary motives from their customers. And so a flight to Albany with plenty of empty seats will leave soon. We won't be on it. But we will be on the flight leaving at a nearby gate to Chicago and once there we will hop a flight to Albany. Bureaucratic policies which focus solely on the bottom line rather than on the customer ultimately will damage the bottom line.

The seats were very uncomfortable as they were the same age as the aircraft. I asked the staff if the plane was a joke, he said it was a last resort plane as they had technical issues with the Dreamliner, which I since found out was untrue. According to AA customer service the flight was changed several weeks earlier and is still being used to date as they said in their words ""we used this aircraft because it was more profitable"". The fact that it is advertised with all the mod cons did not concern them at all. The magazine in the seat pocket was all stuck together and some of them were totally in Spanish. The movie was a Disney movie and the people who made the outbound journey on this flight said the movie was in Spanish and could not be changed. The flight was unable to carry any duty free items as they didn't have anywhere to store it. AA customer service offered us a voucher for $100 off our next flight but like I told them ""Why would we ever fly with them again on a 30 year old aircraft when there are far superior carriers out there that actually give you what you pay for?""

Sat on hold for another 40 plus mins. The representative did nothing in order to help me resolve this issue. Her solution was for me to purchase another ticket. This did not seem to be a customer friendly solution. As a last resort to find a mutually beneficial and reasonable solution to my situation I asked to speak with the manager.

It took her over ten minutes to come in which she proceeded to stand over in a corner and stare at everyone until one of the customer service representatives had to go remind her that I was waiting for her. When she comes over and I tell her what's going on, she denies me assistance because ""she can only help me if one of the customer assistance ladies can't help me.""

After walking into the line and waiting I was speaking to the lady about rebooking my flight to Marquette. Marquette was full that day and I would have been number 13 on standby. So my options were either take a plane to Greenbay (which is 3 hours from Marquette) or wait another 36 hours in an airport to fly to Marquette. Obviously my hands were tied and I chose to go to Greenbay. I was put on standby for an 8:40 AM flight and confirmed on a flight at noon. I sat in the airport until 8 and by this point I had been up over 24 hours. The flight at 8:40 was a bit delayed, and I waited until almost everyone boarded before approaching the boarding assistant and asking them if there were any seats available for people on standby. She asked for my name, I gave it to her, and she told me I wasn't on the standby list. I showed her my ticket proving I was and she denied still that I was on the standby list. She then proceeded to ignore me for a few minutes before closing the flight, telling me she can't help me, and walked away. I needed to get on that flight because I had no way of getting from Marquette to Greenbay except for a friend who could pick me up if I had gotten on the earlier flight. I end up going up to some other people who worked at American Airlines and asked for a supervisor. They asked what the problem was and I told them. They kept telling me I wasn't on the standby list and there was nothing they could do. They ended up telling me to ""go away because there's nothing they can do to help me."" When I finally got to speak to a supervisor, she told me I ended up getting confirmed on the 8:40 flight and there was no way for me to know. This means that their worker neglected to check if I was confirmed and forced me to miss my flight for no reason other than pure laziness. When I finally get to Greenbay, I ask the supervisor there to get me to Marquette somehow. He just shrugged and told me ""he can't help me because I said it was okay for them to get me to Greenbay."" My hands were tied, I had no choice. I ended up having to rend a car for $200 and driving 3 hours sleep deprived to finally get to my destination. So while I had to pay $525 for my ticket, I ended up having to pay a total of $725 just to get to my destination.

I then missed my connecting flight to FNT. The gate agent sent me out to the ticket counter (it's now 10:00pm) and after waiting nearly 2 hours on line, I was told there were no more flights to FNT today, that the following day was all booked, and that maybe they could get me out 2 days later, maybe to another airport like Midland-Bay City, or Grand Rapids or something. No hotel voucher, no meal voucher, no rebooking, no accommodation, nothing at all: simply put, I was abandoned in mid-journey. They failed to take me to my destination, failed to offer anything and would not issue a refund of any kind, claiming this was a ""weather related"" issue and blame the air traffic controllers.

Now this was a problem because we had a nonrefundable reservation at our hotel so we were going to lose a day of our vacation. Eventually, after calling customer service from the plane. We were booked on another flight leaving from Washington DC to Miami. So we get off the plane and take a $100 cab ride for a flight scheduled to leave Dulles at 12:45pm. We get there at about 12:15pm, go through security again, and make it the plane, only to sit on this plane for another 2 hours. Finally we leave and fly to Miami for a flight scheduled to leave a 5:55pm. We're sitting in the airport for 45 minutes and 10 minutes before the flight time they tell us to go to another gate which is in a total different wing of the terminal. So we run to the gate only to find out our 5:55pm flight is delayed. An hour later we board only to sit on yet another plane for almost 2 hours. We made it to St Thomas at 10:30pm. We were originally scheduled to arrive there at 3:30pm. So here we are 16 hours later, and have missed a half a day of our vacation, and AA thinks that was ok. The only thing they could say was oh well, you took the flight, you got there. Our return from St Thomas back home was about the same. Sitting in airports at the wrong gates and delayed flights. In my over 20 years of traveling I have never seen anything like that. This was by far the worst travel experience I've had.";NEGATIVE

The American Airlines representative my husband talked to looked for another flight out of Syracuse for about 15 seconds, told him there were none and insisted that we had to drive to Buffalo or Albany if we wanted to fly out Sunday. We were given no explanation for the cancelled flight and the representative refused to look again for any flights out of Syracuse unless we went out Monday instead. So we inquired about a Rochester flight which was our closest option and booked one. Having jobs we had to get back to. My father in law drove us to and from Rochester.

It also meant the cost of three taxi rides to and from airport d/t the cancellation and then again the following day. Day 2 early morning flight once again, both initial flight and connecting flight, now wasting a full vacation day. Return flight was a repeat of the departure experience with a delay of the initial flight, hourly delays with the connecting flight, and yet another cancellation. Repeated calls to American Airlines, over four weeks, means being transferred to yet another number, only to be told to go online and request refunds, etc. There will be no response to emails.

The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, because the plane was warm and needed to be cooled down, which was supposed to take a ""few minutes"", but took over an hour to begin boarding. The on-plane service was good, the staff friendly and professional and the food was surprisingly very good. The plane was old, with no charging stations or personal entertainment system at individual seats (and I wouldn't call a hanging aisle TV, set at mute, playing some random old movies any kind of entertainment). However, what made the flight especially bad for me was the seat. I had an aisle seat, which I generally like, but the aisle armrest was of the type that couldn't be lifted and the entire flight its corner was constantly eating into my leg. It was 8+ hours of suffering, in a plane which was insufficiently cool. The flight cost just over $500 one way and I think that's a little too much for an old plane with uncomfortable seats and no technology whatsoever. For a no frills plane, the cost should have been no more than $400-450 one way, even during high season.";NEGATIVE

The meal service was also not bad. I was served the first meal (dinner) just one to two hours after takeoff. Between the two main meals (dinner and breakfast), passengers could take snacks and beverages freely in the galley. The food supply was sufficient that I didn't have to starve. The in-flight entertainment system has great room for improvement. The TV was so small and the resolution was terribly low.

Supposedly due to weather, however, we soon learned that the weather delay were the day before and they didn't manage to recover because the plane we were supposed to take was there at the gate but it was a former US Airways plane and they needed therefore a former US Airways crew (stationed in Phoenix), and couldn't do with an American Airlines crew stationed in Dallas. Talk about the benefit of a merger. More than a weather delay, it was a blatant organizational failure. After 5 hours of delay, we were offered the famous airport sandwich, but that's insulting for other sandwiches to call it that. In Aug 16 we took 4 flights with American, for a total of 11 hours delay. It costed us money and precious time.

American staff at AKL were very helpful and provided food, a nice hotel room and shuttle to and from the airport for the night. Next morning we were on our way and a fantastic crew on board.  Also found the return flight home also very good. Food service very good. One item though.

Frantic as I was to locate it, I called OIA and LAX. I must say each and everyone I called were friendly and sympathetic to my problem. When my daughter and I arrived home and realized she had left it on the plane, she went back to OIA and American Airlines Baggage claim advised they did not have it, but to check back the next day. Her plane had already taken back off for somewhere else. My daughter was due in Asheville, NC, so she left from OIA and drove to Asheville. She tried calling on her way up and I spent hours on the phone trying to figure out where that plane had gone. There was a gentleman at LAX by the name of KEN that was very helpful and I thanked him. The next day about 9:30a.m., my daughter texted me that they had found the computer in OIA American Airlines Baggage claim. I drove back to Orlando and gave them the description and retrieved the computer. They were very nice and helpful.

american-airlines;2016-09-02;"Boise to Northwest Arkansas via Dallas Ft Worth. Round trip flight with four legs, first was late, second was canceled twice on two different days, third on time, fourth was late. The canceled flights was the worst. We started late, sat on the tarmac for one hour and returned to the gate. This was weather related and I am ok with that. As soon as we got inside the terminal they announced that the flight was canceled. They also would not give us our luggage, including gate checked luggage, which for us was a wheelchair. Fortunately one of the gate crew retrieved the wheelchair for us. Otherwise it would have been an even greater disaster. When we asked for our luggage they told us it would be at XNA when we got there. When we asked about lodging and meals we were informed that they have no obligation to provide that for weather related issues. When asked about future flights we were told the first available seats were for 8:00 PM the next day. In about an hour the plane left with our luggage for another itinerary. So much for weather related cancellation. They canceled us so they could use that plane for a more profitable flight. That to me that quit being a weather related issue and became a business issue. They did book us on a flight for the next morning. (so much for no seats until 8 PM) When we arrived at the airport that flight had been canceled also. I didn't hear the reason as we were scrambling to get a car to drive up. When we got there our luggage was waiting for us as evidenced by the computer showing it there and the agent being able to deliver it to us and confirm delivery on her computer. Unknown to us, they canceled our return flights the next day. Probably because we never made the second leg of our itinerary. They obviously knew we made it there because we picked up our luggage. I suppose their computers aren't capable of talking to each other. I didn't find out our reservations had been canceled until a week later when I tried to check in and they couldn't find us. I called their help desk and was told the flight from DFW to BOI was fully booked, then after further research they restored all our reservation except for our seats. When I logged in to chose our seats I found quite a few available on both flights, the only downside was that I had to pay an extra $170 because these were considered premium seats, even though two were center seats. Bottom line, avoid American Airlines if at all possible. They have the worst customer service and their integrity is lacking when they cancel you for weather issues and fly about an hour later with other passengers.";NEGATIVE

Check in was a little strange, as the member at the desk made us put up our bags on the belt ourselves. Boarding was delayed for 10 minutes because it was a full flight. Boarding was quick after that. The plane was in the new livery. There were no televisions, so I slept for most of it. As for the seats, I did not recline because there was a person behind me. Something that I was a little surprised is that after serving drinks and snacks, the flight attendants stayed in the back, and did not come out until it was time to serve another drink. Surely you should occasionally walk down the aisle and offer help and check everything? Our time in Phoenix was quick, just enough to use the restroom, and connect gates (we had to change terminals) This plane had the old livery. The ceiling had blue lights, and there were televisions hanging down from the ceiling every 3 seats. Baggage claim in Sacramento was quick.

Therefore if you didn't want to watch Captain Marvel, like me, then I'm afraid it was music only, except from 3 messages which I did not appreciate, the messages via the screen was. Let me clarify, I didn't choose American, I would avoid at all costs in future. The reason I was on American is I booked flights via Skyscanner and it was a BA flight with flight share by American - pity, I swear Ryanair or Jet2 have more legroom. Also as I booked late, I hadn't managed to secure a window seat which I always make use of by guess what? yeh looking out of the window, I really don't get people who have window seats and then have the blind down all of the journey - I don't get it! Please will someone explain that one to me, there were 6 people round us with window seats and blinds down, I wanted to ask each one to keep their blind up, but my wife wouldn't let me.

american-airlines;2016-08-28;"I guess I should start off by saying that this is the first negative review I’ve ever written. I’m normally not one to bash people on the grounds that I like to think the intention is always there, but there is no getting around my last experience with American Airlines. Okay..where do I start. My friends and I are flying from Managua, Nicaragua to Rochester, NY with connecting flights from Managua to Miami, Miami to Charlotte, Charlotte to ROC. Everything is going smoothly up until there is a 30 minute (which turns into an unannounced 50 minute) delay on the Miami to Charlotte flight…which is fine. Delays happen, I get it. However, noticing that we would probably be cutting it close to our next flight, my friend goes to ask if there were other flights we could look into it if we didn't catch it. She starts by saying that we have a connecting flight - until he cuts her off and says “-yeah, you and everyone else.” That was the end of the conversation. I also am not naive to the fact that when people are under stress they can come off as rude, but why work in customer service if you cant handle people? So wheels are down at 10:10 PM in Charlotte and our next flight departs at 10:20 PM - when we get there it’s gone. They could’ve waited 5 minutes if they knew that was the last flight out! Anyway, so we get up to the front desk after an hour wait in customer service and although the lady is very sweet, she has no idea what she's doing. It takes about 40 minutes for her to get us a hotel and book us flight the next day from Charlotte to Chicago, Chicago to ROC. We notice the next morning that there was a direct flight to Buffalo available that we said we’d be willing to fly into, but she didn't even inform us about it. So after we fly into Chicago, we get to the gate just in time to check in - only to find out that we’re not even confirmed for the flight!! The man is rude and not helpful at all. he shoos us away to the customer service phone. Thankfully, I was on standby for that flight and had a back-up flight through United (unlike my friends). So we make the trek over to the United terminal and a lady solved all our problems in about 15 minutes, all while being personable, friendly, and professional. Turns out I wasn’t even confirmed for the United flight, but she made sure I was while also confirming later flights for my friends.

We were pleasantly surprised that we would be put up in a hotel free of charge for the night until we got to the hotel only to be told that no one had called from the airline to book our room and we were not given the proper documentation to do so. We called the 800 number and were rudely told they did not handle hotel issues over the phone and that we needed to return to the airport. When we got to the airport no one was behind the desk so we paged for an employee to come to the desk twice. We waited for over 30 minutes before a supervisor showed up behind the desk. As we started to talk she hardly made eye contact and rudely told us ""I am off the clock, I can't help you, were closed"" and continued walking out the door. We then called the 800 number again and we talked to a very helpful employee who was able to contact another supervisor who was still at the airport. This supervisor was very nice and fixed our problem right away. She printed off our hotel voucher and even gave us complimentary breakfast for in the morning.

With AA, my partner and I were able to choose regular economy seats for free in advance, and the A330 with its 2x4x2 configuration is preferable to the dense 3x3x3 configuration BA offers out of PHL (no stranger sitting next to us). Also, the seat pitch is better then BA's new claustrophobic arrangement, and the seats themselves were much more comfortable. In addition, the A330 offered individual air vents, which BA do not on their aircraft out of PHL, allowing me to better control the temperature. The food on AA was better than BA as well, and complimentary wine was offered with meals, with refills freely provided. The AVOD system worked well and a USB power port was provided at each seat. Flight attendants on both flights were very courteous, and the ATH-PHL segment featured a warm meal, followed later by ice cream, followed by a snack, and then followed with a warm sandwich and a muffin prior to landing - very impressed. After this experience I will be choosing AA for all my future transatlantic travel out of PHL.";POSITIVE

When we went to rebooking, we quickly learned there were no available seats to CID until the next day at 10.00 am. Now this is where the frustration kicks in. Rebooking told us to find a gate agent, they would be able to help. We found a gate agent and asked for help. She educated us that rebooking should have sent us to the main ticket desk. So, we went back out through security to the main ticket counter. There we were told we would not receive any compensation for rental car, or hotel. Clearly this was not a weather related issue.

We arrived for our flight home to Florida to find a long, long line of waiting passengers. Eventually a man from American Airlines walked along the line and told us ""All flights out are cancelled due to bad weather in Dallas, wait in line to see what options are available "" After a 3 hour wait (I am 68 years old and with a bad back) where American had 1 staff member working for economy passengers and 5 others that I counted standing around doing nothing we gave up and went to try to find a hotel. Where is the concept or understanding of ""Customer Service""? Is is completely beyond the ability of American Airlines to get their staff to actually serve their customers or is it that they just don't care about anyone anymore? I despair at how service has deteriorated so badly and I certainly won't fly American again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-08-24;" |  American Airlines overbooked for the leg of my trip from Philadelphia to Chicago, then decided to use a different type of airplane, which apparently required calling in a different crew. As a result I was delayed in Philadelphia for two hours, then held on the runway at Chicago for an hour, which caused me to just miss my connecting flight from Chicago to Oklahoma City. When we finally did arrive at the gate in Chicago, there was no one there to assist me in getting another flight, despite the fact that the delay was due to their decisions and also despite the fact that I was supposed to have wheelchair service at all stops. I also did not have wheelchair service at Philadelphia like I was supposed to. I am disabled and I ended up having to walk the Chicago O'Hare concourse to a different gate I was directed to, only to be told at that gate that they could not help me and I would need to use the rebooking phone to book the remainder of my flight home myself. To top it off, the rebooking phone agent was not able to assist me with hotel or food vouchers, or with information about my bags. For that, I had to stand in the domestic ticketing line for two hours, then I was issued a hotel voucher that ended up being worthless because too many vouchers were issued for that hotel, and they were full. By the time I discovered this, the AA domestic ticket counter was closed for the night, so my only option was to book a hotel last minute on my own. I have emailed AA customer service, but have so far received no reply, despite the fact that it has been four days since I emailed. There is no way to reach customer service by phone, you are always directed back to their email on the website.";NEGATIVE

When I boarded I didn't find a toothbrush set on my seat which is very disappointing on an overnight flight. The legroom was amazing, and that's what you expect when flying Main Cabin Extra. The seats were a bit wider than in normal Economy but didn't recline enough. They weren't as comfortable as the soft and comfy BA B747 ones and I wasn't able to sleep at all. The IFE was good with a huge range of music, many TV shows, and a adequate music on- demand radio choice. The power outlets were universal and it charged fast unlike the USB plug of the IFE. The service was good and kind, provided 3 drinks but you can ask them anytime to give you another one. The meal (I chose pasta) was pretty good, and came with a salad with dressing, a bun, crackers, cheddar, butter and a brownie. The breakfast was a fat free strawberry yougurt, a little bag of cereal for the yogurt, a cranberry snack and a flat over-processed muffin.

We ran and made that plane only to sit on the Tarmac in Miami for another hour plus (the other passengers had been waiting much longer than that). Finally we took off for La Paz where we were to remain on the plane for our continuing flight to Santa Cruz. We waited, and waited and after around 2 hours the captain informed us that the crew had passed it's legal time and was deplaning. So we deplaned and went through customs. Finally we arrived at the AA counter where we stood another 2 hours in line only to be given an 80.00 bolivian voucher for breakfast which didn't come close to paying for anything to eat but we appreciated the effort. AA apparently was not able to complete its obligation to get us to our destination so they put us on a BOA plane and got us to Santa Cruz after another nearly 6 hour wait. The last part may not come as a surprise but for good measure the luggage was still sitting in Miami when we arrived in Santa Cruz. AA made me pay for a taxi the next day to go back to the airport to pick up my luggage and be subjected to searches and immigration all over again.

The breakfast meal, yogurt, a granola bar and orange juice, was uninspiring. Transferring in DFW was easy. There were 2 attendants in first class on the flight to Charlotte. Both were much better than the one I had going to DFW. The meal, itself, left a lot to be desired. The ""hot"" towels that were passed out were room-temperature. so were the ""warm"" nuts. I had ravioli that was served with a ""salad"" which consisted of lettuce, one grape tomato that was sliced in half, and a cucumber slice. The salad dressing was straight of a packet. The ravioli were OK. Actually, the best part of the meal was the pretzel roll that was served with the meal. It was quite good. Sadly, there was no dessert.

The outbound flight was canceled via text message at midnight, 9 hours before the scheduled departure with the excuse given that AA had no staffing for that flight and rescheduled us for the following day (36 hours later).

I checked the flight online and discovered that there were 8 available seats. Another phone call back to AA. I presented our case and managed to get us on a new flight that left 4 hours earlier than our original. We grabbed our bags (1:15am) and rushed to the airport. The remainder of that day was uneventful. Fast forward 8 days later after an incredible stay in Cozumel, we land in Dallas for our connection to Denver. We waited 2.5 hours at the gate. AA informs us of a 15 min delay, then a 30 min delay, then a 45 min delay. Finally a gate attendant announces that the plane is on the ground and that they need to deplane, clean up a bit and then we will be on our way. 5 minutes later we see the gate monitor change from an 11pm departure time to a 6am (the following day). This was followed by an announcement the the crew had ""timed out"" and the flight had been canceled. No apologies, no attempt to rebook flights. The gate closed and we were left sitting there.

Due to a death in the family, I was trying to fly my wife in to attend the funeral. The day of her flight, we got 5 departure time updates in 30 minutes, the last of which pushing up the departure time an hour and thirty minutes from the original posted time. Because we were traveling over that just to get to the airport, although I sped, ran red lights, etc, they would not allow her on the plane even though it was still connected to the airbridge and she missed that flight. Although they were ""willing to work with us"" (if that's what you want to call it), their make up flight for her wasn't supposed to leave until the next day, it was taking her to an airport 2.5 hours north of where she needed to be, and it wasn't even going to arrive until after the funeral. After some back and forth between myself and the ticket counter, I worked out a deal where she would fly from Wilmington, NC to Charlotte, NC, stay the night, and then depart on a United Airlines flight from Charlotte, NC to Dallas and stay on United Airlines from Dallas to her final destination. Well, at 0645 this morning, my wife calls to inform me that although American Airlines printed her a boarding pass with a seat number and everything, they failed to fund the flight change from American to United, so she will now not be allowed on that flight either. Their final fix to the problem is to now send her from Charlotte to Atlanta to Dallas to her final destination all on American Airlines. Her flight won't get in until 2 hours after the funeral, but I guess I should just be happy she's going to get to go home at this point (assuming they don't screw this up too, of which I'm not confident). I dread to see how bad they're going to screw us on the return trip. Their coordination, communication, and customer support is hands down the worst I've ever encountered. Everyone we've dealt with so far (around 7 individuals) have all given us attitude and been unwilling to put in a little leg work to fix the problem that their airline created in the first place. American Airlines is an absolute joke of an airline and an organization. If there were more steps that I knew of to take this matter further up the chain of command, I would, but because subordinate actions are a reflection of leadership, I wouldn't expect anything to come of it. If I could give advice to any new traveler, avoid American Airlines at all costs. I'm not here to advocate other airlines, but I can tell you that if you go with American and are depending on them to get you where you need to go when you need to get there, you'll be greatly disappointed and just as frustrated as I am right now with them.";NEGATIVE

The customer service is giving me false reasons for the delays in order to protect them from being liable. I run a business and I am potentially losing multiple customers for my inability to be available to them, directly because of this airlines inability to put a flight together to take off at the time I paid for. If you plan to go somewhere at the time you pay to go there at, do not even consider using this airline. You will not get there. I will never book another flight with this establishment.

Needless to say we did not depart until 6:45pm. The flight that I was to be connecting to was going up in the air when we were descending. When we got off that flight went straight to customer service to find another flight to get me to Las Vegas that night as I already had reservations at the hotel. No flight was available until the following morning at 8am. So I lost out on 1 night of my hotel reservation plus another 1/2 day worth of travel. The airport did put me in a hotel for the night instead of having to sleep in the airport but that did not get me my time back. I then had to book another night in Las Vegas so that I could enjoy what time I was supposed to be there. On the return flights, the attendant at the desk in Las Vegas at the gate was very rude to customers.

I really didn't mind the delay at all because I knew that there was nothing that they could have done, what is done is done. But were there not any protocol to check the plane before letting passenger board the airplane? We sat there for a hour before they told us that everyone have to leave the airplane because they couldn't fix it and they need to give us a new airplane. So our flight was supposed to depart at 6:30 a.m. but we did not depart until 8:30 a.m. We got back on the plane and sit there for another hour because there was some ""computer glitches."" Obviously, we missed our connecting flight. Once we landed in Dallas to try to catch our connecting flight that we already missed, the staff handed us some new boarding pass to our new connecting flight which was a thumb up. But wait, that wasn't it. They gave us the wrong boarding pass, because while my husband and I waited for our plane to get boarded, we heard over the intercom, ""Last call for (our names) to Santa Ana."" My husband and I look at each other and was confuse on why do another flight have our names instead of the flight we were supposed to get on by the boarding pass the staff hand out to us. Well, we couldn't complain because it was an earlier flight or we will have to wait for another hour, but we were really concern about our baggages. When we arrived to Santa Ana, we did got our baggages, so that was maybe one thing that AA did right. On our flight back home, everything was going well. The flight were on time, no delays, we didn't have any problem. But once we arrive to Phoenix for our connecting flight, there were some problems. When I handed that staff my boarding pass, I couldn't board, because I ""did not check in."" If I did not check in, how did I arrived to Phoenix from California? And how did I have my boarding pass in my hand? My mother in law and husband is checked in and able to board, but I wasn't able to when we obviously all checked in together. Obviously AA is horrible with delay, so they obviously bump me off the flight and give my seat to someone else that flight was delay. My husband was not having it, after throwing a little scene, they offered to give me a $500 voucher and a hotel room. Of course, I was not having it, time could not be bought. But thankfully another passenger volunteer to stay so I could take their seat. But it's ridiculous how my seat was given to someone else and they overbooked the flight.

Now I can understand if there had been multiple guest that asked rude questions how her ""customer service"" skills could have been strained, however no one had spoken with her and her immediate answer was defensive, hostile and rude to a simple, polite question, American Airlines maybe while you are ""negotiating contracts"" you take your guest who faithfully fly with you into consideration and retrain your staff in customer service skills to be slightly more understanding and just polite to the innocent bystanders that just want to get home to their families.

By the time we boarded (Group 1) the plane was already full and there was no room for a backpack under the seat in front of me. The passenger in front of me had a huge bag overhead, another under the seat in front of him, and another under his seat.

Then they said I could pay an additional $75.00 and go stand by. When I said I had already paid to get to Milwaukee I was told that it was a take it or leave it option.

american-airlines;2016-08-06;"Sacramento to Flagstaff. Once again a completely disastrous experience with this airline. Years ago flying from Orlando to Sacramento they left us stranded in Phoenix and offered no assistance whatsoever. We literally watched them put our luggage on the plane as they slammed the door in our face and said sorry it's to late and left us stranded in Phoenix with 2 young kids without our luggage. Thank god for Southwest, we were able to buy tickets to get home the same day. All they offered after we contacted their customer service was a voucher for future flights, no refund for the flight they failed to let us board. So this experience was just as horrific! Except worse! Our departure from Sacramento was scheduled for early morning so we decided to stay at a hotel to be closer and allow us extra time. When we arrived they informed us the plane had hit a bird while landing which I completely understand is out of their control. The way they handled things were where the disaster began. There was clearly no sense of urgency from the ground crew to inspect or repair anything, no repairs were needed. None the less delayed for 2 hours made our connection to Flagstaff impossible. When we asked to get on the next flight we were informed by another non-caring American Airlines employee that the rest of the flights for the day were full so they could only get us there the next morning. For a 30 minute flight we opted to rent a car and drive so we wouldn't loose any more of our already shortened weekend time with our daughter. When we asked for our luggage they rudely informed us that we would have to wait until it showed up in Flagstaff later that night - and you'll never guess but that flight was delayed too!  When we arrived at the Flagstaff airport Sunday after our shortened weekend visit with our daughter, they checked us through security, took our bags and then informed everyone they had an issue with one of the plane doors and we would be delayed. After about an hour they informed everyone that they were sending a bus to pick us up and drive us to Phoenix since they were unable to resolve the door issue. Once again missing our connection flight back home. We again opted to rent a car and head on our own way so we would be assured of getting to Phoenix as quickly as possible. What a total nightmare thanks to American Airlines once again! It might not have been so bad if they had just one person that actually acted like they cared and maybe attempted to be simpathetic. I wish someone else flew into Flagstaff.";NEGATIVE

We were stuck at the airport from 6:30pm to 3am because the flight kept getting delayed so finally they say it's time to board, so we wait some more. Than they decide to switch the gate number on us, so we arrive at the gate and wait another 30 minutes. Than they tell us the flight has been cancelled for an unacceptable reason! It was late and the kids were extremely tired. They took forever to reroute us to another day. They give us a hotel voucher, so we finally get to the hotel after 3am to find out all the rooms were booked. What a nightmare of a day we had. It kept getting worse by the hour!

american-airlines;2016-08-04;"In an attempt to reach a memorial service in Austin, TX, I booked an American Airlines trip on 7/28/16 from Dayton, OH to Austin. It would take me through ORD, where everything would go wrong. We had no issues flying into ORD, arriving at 1200 CT. The connecting flight to AUS was scheduled for 1400 CT, but was delayed for an hour and a half (AA1474). The delays continued as the ticket counter informed us repeatedly that we had an aircraft but we had no crew to fly it. After delaying multiple times and moving gates three times (anyone who's flown through ORD knows how awful that is), we were finally informed that our crew had landed and were preparing to run their security checks in the aircraft. At this point, we were lined up and ready to board at 1900 CT - over 7 hours delayed because of crew issues. Out of nowhere, the counter announced the flight was cancelled but would give us no information whatsoever. The agents were rude and dismissive, only giving us re-booking numbers. Because of their ridiculous delays (how the largest US carrier doesn't have pilots on standby in one of the world's busiest airports is beyond me), there were no flights out of ORD that would get me into Austin in time for the memorial the following day. Because there was no point to travel to Austin, I requested to return home and have my money refunded to me (a fair request considering I would miss my event and I spent an entire day in ORD because their incompetence.). The agent informed me that they could only offer a voucher because the trip was marked cancelled due to weather. This was an outright lie as they repeatedly noted that it was crew related. I work in private aviation with access to FAA databases, and everything noted about the flight involves crew issues. There were even other aircraft flying at that same time from ORD to other Texas locations (DFW was a flight I attempted to fly on but was full). AA changed the cancellation reason because they aren't financially responsible to refund airfare and/or offer hotel vouchers. I even requested a food voucher at 2100 CT, and they refused that because my original flight was cancelled for weather. I have sent them multiple requests for a refund, but they refuse. They haven't even offered a phone number to contact their customer relations dept, as they only contact customers through an un-returnable email. It's absurd for them to think that I would want their voucher. I will never fly with this airline again. I would avoid them as well because when things go poorly, they will treat you like dirt and lie about it to your face.";NEGATIVE

At the airport counter nobody seemed to care about giving out any information. When we finally got on the plane, to our business class seats, everything was dirty and smelt horrible. We had to wait an extra 45 minutes inside the plane because they had forgotten to bring some of the luggage onboard the plane. Business class cabin crew served dinner and nuts and that was that. Never even tried to make the flight a good experience after more than 8 hours of delay. So much turbulence during the flight and a horrible landing. Our experience was terrible.

We booked our flights with American Airlines and the flight was operated by Iberia. The experience was terrible with both companies was terrible. On the flight over our flight was delayed and we missed our connection in Madrid, we were put on an extra flight that took us to Santiago and then to Palma, Mallorca. We arrived to Mallorca 12 hours delayed - that was out of the airlines control.  When we went to check in for our flight back home we were told that none of us (5 passengers) were on the flight list! We stood at the check in counter for an hour and a half while the costumer service agent tried to fix the problem and give us a new booking. Apparently while our flight over was altered due to the delay and missed connection someone deleted us from the flight list on our return flights, so that we appeared on the flight list but could not have boarding passes printed. The agent was able to fix all of our flights but one, she could not figure out how to reissue the ticket for my cousin from Madrid to New York so we had to leave him behind at the airport in Madrid. Iberia staff members including supervisors told us that their ability to fix this issue was limited because it was technically an American Airlines booking, however they could not get a representative from American Airlines to be of assistance (and neither could I on my 3 international phone calls for over an hour to America Airlines) Technically my cousins ticket was canceled so all that he could do was go and buy a ticket for the following day. all that was left was a business class seat which he had to pay $5,000 for! Not to mention pay for a hotel room in Madrid for the night! We are appalled and lost a lot of money because of this, his flight, his hotel, his international call bill, the toll back from the airport, the extra gas money spent picking him up separately.

Welcome water/juice/champaign offered along with amenity kits, blanket, pillow already at the seat. Business cabin about 2/3 full - excellent flight attendant served my aisle and she was accommodating, full of smiles and happy to chat. Departed 5 minutes early and 7 hours 35 min to Dusseldorf. Excellent halibut dinner and nice breakfast served. The one thing American can never get right is inflight entertainment. The Samsung tablets are nice but always have issues with the plugs and keeping them charged. And the movie and TV selection is prehistoric - one episode of a show? Emirates has entire seasons! Come on AA - get with the 21st century! And even worse in coach with no PTV's! Landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule and off the plane and thru immigration in minutes.

Checkin was done at one station, while weighing of checked in luggages and the drop off for the luggages were at some other stations. While the queues at each station was short, it nevertheless required some effort, patience and time to figure out which was the station to get to first, and then negotiate the crowds to get to the next stations. There were a fair amount of confused travelers wondering where they were supposed to get to. I would rather stand in line for the usual check-in counters which handle everything from check-in to luggage drop-offs. The cabin crew were busy getting everyone settled at the start of the flight. They were friendly and there was lots of interaction with the passengers. I had pre-selected a seat at the back of the aircraft but was asked by the crew if I was willing to take an exit row seat somewhere in the middle of the aircraft.

american-airlines;2016-07-31;" |  I would like to say how disappointed I was with my experience with American Airlines. I recently traveled overseas from Philadelphia to Athens with my family. Firstly, I expected anyone with children to be among the first to be boarded. I was, I believe the only one with a 9 month old baby in addition to my 3 1/2 year old toddler. To my surprise, and I'm sure the other parents, we never heard a ""anyone with young children, please feel free to board"" call. Secondly, I was extremely aggravated and angered that I couldn't get the bassinet and seat that goes with it for my baby and I. I called American Airlines weeks before and even 24 hours before my flight, not to mention my Travel Agent who requested that seat for me when they booked my tickets, and was told that ""we don't reserve the bassinet. it's first come, first served"". I can appreciate that and even understand that. What I can't understand is when I arrive at the gate to get it I am told that ""a bassinet is available however the seats have been taken by some people who requested the extra leg room"".  I guess American Airlines is fine with giving a seat to someone for extra leg room over a baby who needs a bassinet to sleep in? I had to hold my baby for a 9 hour flight and keep handing her over to my husband to hold while I took my toddler to the bathroom or so I could eat my meal that the flight attendant kindly put aside for me. The flight attendants were the best part of the flight. Thirdly, I didn't appreciate the fact that the assigned seats for my family had my 3 1/2 year seated between two complete strangers while my husband and I were directly behind her with the baby. Obviously, my husband switched so that my child would be with me but who is in charge of seating arrangements that can't understand the concept of keeping a child together with their parents? You would think they'd keep a family of 3 with a lap baby all together but I guess I'm the only one who thinks like that. Suffice it to say, in all likeliness I will not be using American Airlines to travel in the future. I have my return tickets already booked and would probably be charged to change them or else I would switch them with another airline to return home. ";NEGATIVE

They delivered our luggage in the middle of the night and when we opened it in the morning, everything was drenched and much of our clothes were ruined. White clothes had blue stains on them.

Granted, it would be no cost to us however the frustrating part about this is they said nothing about my bag that was the exact same size, not to mention the numerous other passengers we saw pass us to board the plane with same size bags or larger. Ours both fit perfectly fine in all the overhead bins we had used in previous AA flights. I tried to ask the agent if this was necessary considering I was not asked to check mine even when it's the same size but she insisted it was. I feel as if American Airlines targeted us (my wife) for no apparent reason. We did not want to check our bags for a reason, they met the size requirements and we wanted to be able to get off the plane and not wait for our luggage. In addition to all this, they had us board the plane and sit at the gate while they fixed 3 machanical issues before pushing off. Perhaps fix the issues before loading 100s of people onto a plane with not a lot of air circulation?

Flight was delayed by over an hour due to 'paperwork issues'. This meant I missed my connection in Dallas to Cancun. No information at all was forthcoming at Dallas airport about what happened next and as it was a Sunday evening there were no other flights they could rebook me on to. They provided a voucher for a hotel, and basic food voucher but could not give me my luggage back until I arrived in Cancun, so I was left stranded on my own in Dallas without luggage, and arrived in Cancun a day late having missed the first day of my pre-organised tour. Flight attendants were useless, and didn't seem to even recognise that there were passengers on the plane - they were constantly knocking into people sat in the aisle seats. Barely any communication from the pilots. On the way back, I flew Cancun to Miami to Raleigh-Durham to Heathrow. The pilots on the Raleigh-Durham flight were much better and communicated everything. As a nervous flyer this helps a lot.

The only good thing about this flight was the very friendly and personal captain, who came out into the boarding area of the airport to great us with a warm welcome and some information regarding the tropical storm Darby as it would delay our flight. This captain also kept us well informed throughout the flight. Rest of flight crew was disinterested at best, which is understandable given the poor hard product they have to make do with.

Our original departure time from Chicago was 6.45pm on 21/07/16, we were now further away from our destination and leaving approx. 13 hours later, at 9.05am on 22/07/16. Next thing, we were given a hotel voucher to get a few hours sleep (it was almost midnight at this stage). Customer service told us to go and wait on hotel shuttle and ring the number on the voucher to call them if no sign after 30 minutes or so. Of course, no shuttle came! So we rang the number printed on the hotel voucher! 3 phone calls and 2 hours later, we realised that the number was wrong. We had been calling a different shuttle (it was 2am at this stage). We googled the correct number and finally got in touch with the correct hotel. Next morning, we wen to check-in staff and staff at the gate and asked them to make sure our bags were on the flight. They assured us they were! We got our flight from Dallas to Miami and Miami to Lima. Might I add, both of these flights were delayed. We arrived in Lima 1 hour and 15 minutes late and of course my bag was lost. Turns out, the bag never left Miami! We asked for the bag to be put on the next flight. We finally got out of the airport after midnight. We had a taxi waiting to collect us for 2 hours.  I rang this morning to ask about my bag. It was still in Miami! I rang 10 hours later today to ask where my bag is, still in Miami! We had 2 days to spend in Lima. We missed one day because of a cancelled flight, a delayed flight, a missed connection etc. We missed the second day as I have no clothes to wear and also trying to track my bag and make a complaint about American Airlines.

In just the last 3 days, I had an issue with a rebooking, a flight that was cancelled and moved to the next day, and then a delay on my way back to Boston. I'm surprised there were so many issues. I also heard several complaints from other American customers who had to pay for a hotel because their flight was cancelled, and word of mouth travels fast. I hope American starts to realize the importance of customer service. ";NEGATIVE

They gave no explanation for the cancellation. They rebooked me on a flight that would get me in 10 hours late. They would not make any effort or go to any expense to find a flight that would get me to my destination even close to the time I needed. They offered no apology or compensation even though the flight that I purchased originally was significantly more expensive than the one they put me on. I will avoid American Airlines in the future whenever possible.;NEGATIVE

Long and short of it, there was a line of planes ahead of us. They would not allow anyone off and we sat there for about 2 hours before getting refueled while being told we were headed back to Phoenix shortly. No food, people missed connecting flights, I was forced to say overnight in Phoenix and missed a very important day of work in Omaha. American insisted they would not offer any compensation in terms of food, hotel, etc., since it was weather related. On top of I found out from another flyer the hotel rooms offered at a ""discount"" at the Red Lion Inn were actually more expensive than their regular prices. Waiting in American Airlines customer service line was horrible, took a long time (over an hour) with lots of angry people. By the time I got another flight the next day and a room I got 2 hours of sleep. I understand things happen with weather, but the way American Airlines handled this during and after was the worst flying experience I've had to date and I'm 57 years of age. I will avoid flying American Airlines from this point forward and avoid them aggressively.";NEGATIVE

It was a short haul flight and the expectations for the meals were low - just a small packet of chips or cookies instead of e.g. a breakfast are definitlely a taboo for a first class service. Furthermore, the variety of beverages was very limitated and coffee was out of stock soon. The cabin facilities have seen better days as well due to the fact that they were certainly in use for decades. The cabin staff was not unfriendly but just executed their duties.

The minute they served the meal they asked the passengers to close the shutters and they disappeared not to be seen until the next meal. The crew on the way from Miami to Milan were the untidiest crew I have ever seen. This crew did not even bother to greet the passengers as we got on and off the plane. It was such a relief to get on Vueling where the crew were the exact opposite. I would never recommend AA and I will defininetly avoid it in future.";NEGATIVE

After delays they switched our flight, on our connecting flight through London the plane had to land in JFK because of computer glitches and they did not feel safe flying over the ocean. After 2 hours of waiting to receive new boarding passes everyone finally boarded a new air craft that would take us instead. Once everyone was seated they immediately told us that there were glitches and we had to exit the plane and that there would be no new flights until the morning. At this point we had now missed an entire day in Venice, lost all of our money spent on hotels and tours in Venice. We have a friend that is there alone waiting for us now for days. After they made us exit the plane at 2am we spent over 3 hours talking with managers and attendants to find a new plane to Venice because at this point if we boarded the morning connecting plane through London we would miss the plane to Venice and the following plane to Venice would make us miss another day, which at that point we were supposed to be going to Florence. During the duration of time we spent after being exited from the plane, they put us on a completely different flight out of LaGuardia and promised that our bags would be moved from JFK to LaGuardia. As we just showed up to pick up our bags we have been told that in fact the bags were never taken off of the plane and are now in London. We spent hours trying to call American Airlines and spent hours talking with different people who have all basically lied to us. The amount of money and time I have wasted is inexcusable.

Trip home from Tucson to White Plains on July 9 was similar. Delayed flight from Tucson to Chicago due to weather problems and maintenance issues. Cancelled flight from Chicago to White Plains. Spent the night in Chicago (only 4 hours at the hotel), flew to Charlotte and then to White Plains.

Rerouted us with a nice 6 hour delay then put us on United which we got to the gate and said nope, no ticket, no plane and sent us back to American who sent us back to ticketing past security in Atlanta.

Generally excellent service, better than other American Airlines flights (for different city pairs) on average. Plenty of leg room in first (better than Delta but not as spiffy looking), pre-ordered omelette was good enough, and service was frequent without being over done.

Wish someone had told us to avoid American at all costs. Ground staff and flight attendants acted tired and bored. We needed to use one of those carts that carry you from one gate to another (walk would be about 3/4 mile). Finally got one. The driver suddenly stopped and started talking to a friend. When we asked, she said ""you have to get off, go down the escalator and get another one."" Then she returned to her conversation. Needless to say the $5 tip went back into my husband's pocket.

american-airlines;2016-07-11;" |  Toronto to Phoenix via Chicago (outbound) and Charlotte (inbound). A bit of a mixed bag to be honest. For $430 CAD extra, I was able to upgrade from Economy to Business for the shorter legs and First Class to/from Phoenix. Unfortunately, a month before departure the Toronto to Chicago leg was changed to a smaller aircraft with no business class. No apology or compensation and not even a free alcoholic drink on the plane. Easy check-in, slow security (as always - Pearson being possibly the worst airport for security lines in N America) and an ok lounge with one free drink. Late boarding and departing on a small canadian regional jet with possibly the most disinterested crew member ever. He was just not interested, barely raised a smile, clearly bored and did the minimum required. On time arrival into O'Hare and on time boarding and departure on an A321 to Phoenix. Seat was ok, IFE on my ipad was average but no free wifi (hardly first class service). Slow service on boarding with a long wait for a drink. After departure, hot towel, menu, drink and meal service with wine. Poor quality dinner of steak (overcooked) and gloopy polenta) There was no bread available due to it not being loaded (on a sunday). Surely operating an airline is a 7 day a week business. The saving grace was the Purser who served the cabin well but by herself (and therefore slow). A second drink was offered and service was generally good. The A321 return trip to Charlotte was similar, an ok lounge at Phoenix with some good snacks and a free drink, on time departure, but again slow service on boarding. The meal bizarrely was a salad to start following by a prawn salad with plenty of booze. Again, the purser provided singular but excellent service to the cabin and was omni present and friendly. Charlotte to Toronto was with Eagle on an E175 which on time. Surly crew who offered snacks and one drink. (A second was given on request). Interestingly for me, other experiences with another major US carrier had excellent crew on the farmed out flights to sub contractors, and awful mainline service. With American it was the reverse - much better service with the mainline crew on the A321 and poor and miserable service on the feeder carriers. Was it worth the $430 return for the upgrade (at the time of booking) - just about. American were underwhelming - nothing particualy bad, but definately not first class service.";POSITIVE

After arriving from Amarillo I found out that my flight to Seoul would be delayed 2 hours, meaning that I would miss my last connection flight to Jakarta. When asking the ground service about why the delay, they just rudely told me, ""Maintenance. That's all I know."" They also gave off a tone that seemed as if they hated their job. On top of this, during the actual flight that the delay was only for getting another plane ready. The old cabin sure added to the experience. The IFE was messed up, so Economy class was stuck watching Disney channel shows on repeat for the 13 hour flight. I also recall a cockroach crawling into my seat, but I wasn't surprised, so I didn't do anything about it.

However flying London Heathrow - Los Angeles every month, the service seems to be of a higher standard. Los Angeles - Sydney was the same aircraft, but no bar food. Flight attendants were tired on both legs of the trip. They were unpleasant and when asking for something, it was evidently a hassle. Bar - which 777-300ER on AA is now known for has no food option except a few apples and wine. Really? This is their selling point. I often appreciate not having to bother the crew and getting snacks myself. No mid-flight snacks are offered, no water run or anything. Crew just sit in the rest area playing on their ipads or reading books. When asked if I could get a wine or something I was met with ""You seem to be up the whole time."" As if to say - don't bother us and go to bed. Overall really disappointed with the service. I should fly QF again I guess after this. Their seat is nowhere as comfortable, but food is amazing and soft product/service is excellent. AA needs to keep an eye on these ""prestigeous"" routes.";NEGATIVE

Similar to what you see in an economy plus cabin. No in-seat entertainment system. Instead each business class passenger provided with Samsung tablet and headphones. Image quality OK. Selection of movies poor. Also entertainment system requires the only outlet in the seat. Seat tray table is too small for meal and tablet and requiring you to stow tablet during meal service on balance it on your knee. No wi-Fi in cabin. Food quality was poor. The filet steak I was served was over cooked to the point that I could not eat it. Appetizer was a tomato salad followed by a Caesar salad and a steak or fish entree and small slice of cake. Two salads. Obviously not much thought given to the menu. Cabin staff were friendly but not overly helpful. Glasses not refilled. Water bottles left on armrests without being cleared. Amenity kit was also very poor. Toothbrush, eye mask, ear plugs and some free samples from Bigelowe. Again it reminded me of an economy class product.

My flight was scheduled to leave Hartford at 1.00 pm on July 1st. We boarded on time and immediately started backing away from the gate. We then stopped and sat in place for 15 minutes and eventually returned to gate before sitting another 20 minutes. we were then told there were computer related issues and maintenance needed to be called. Apparently maintenance isn't stationed at the airport and was 30 minutes out. We were asked to deboard and wait and see. I had a 4.20 connector flight in Charlotte that was missed. The AA employees would not reschedule connections until they knew the status of the current flight. At 2.30 I received a call from AA with a new 6.20 connection time. Still no word on the current flight. At 3.00 we were told plane was fixed and reboarded. 30 minutes later we were still sitting at the gate. We were then told Charlotte airspace was closed and we needed to wait for reroute. We finally backed from gate at 3.40 and given permission to fly. At 3.50 we were then ""grounded"" for supposed weather. We sat on runway for another 30 minutes, and finally took off at 4.20. While on plane I asked the stewardess about making the 6.20 connection flight and was told she had no idea and couldn't find anything out. We landed in Charlotte at exactly 6.04. We landed at B gate. My connection was in E concourse. I sprinted the 1/2 mile to the gate and arrived at 6.15 for 6:20 flight. Plane was still there, doors still open. I was told I couldn't get on plane. I explained my flight was delayed 3 hours. I was rudely told I couldn't get on the plane and told to ""go around corner to reschedule"". I arrived at desk at 6.24 to rebook my connection. The attendant looked at his watch and asked why I didn't get on this plane. The next flight out was 5 hours later. I ended up requesting to fly to another airport having my husband drive 2 hours to pick me up. Flight home July 4: No problem from Myrtle Beach to Charlotte. Flight out of Charlotte scheduled for 8.20 pm to Hartford. Walked to gate to confirm location. Went to eat and came back to get to find gate was moved back to D concourse. Time also delayed 30 minutes. Time kept getting pushed back. A plane arrived and deboarded and were told we had to wait for service. At 9.00 we were told the plane was not cleared to fly. After 15 minutes we were sent back to B concourse. Boareded a plane there and again sat on plane for 30 minutes at gate awaiting who knows what. Ultimately took off 1.5 hours late. Overall poor customer service, significant delays, and no consideration for passengers who spent a lot of money to fly there airline.

The planes are falling apart and don't expect anything if you complain. AA like to make you angry by reading a script about how sorry they are. Any day that is spent on an AA plane or within a 2 metre radius of an AA staff member is bound to be a bad day for the customer. Don't fly with AA unless you have to for business like I do.";NEGATIVE

The partitions had foam insulation surrounding the edges. The window frames were literally falling off. The bottoms of the luggage containers had smears, showing they hadn't been cleaned in ages. Talk about deferred maintenance, and this was the first class cabin.

After they made all the passengers board earlier than scheduled because bad weather was approaching, we sat at the gate for 45 minutes because they had some catering issues. Apparently there weren't enough refreshments for all of us. The A/C of the cabin was broken (I assumed) since it was only blowing hot air. The only time that airplane was cool was when we took altitude. The flight crew couldn't care less about the passengers. They took as long as they could to replenish the freezers with the refreshments and to serve the drinks during the flight. They didn't even pick up the trash. After landing, we encountered yet another surprise: we didn't have a gate. I recommend choosing a cheaper airline. ";NEGATIVE

I have flown Flight 1377 Chicago - Miami three times in the last two months and have had delays of 5 and 4 hours on these flights. Each time, there was no plane waiting at the gate and we were told they 'were doing maintenance at the hangar' and it would be ferried over shortly. Hours later, when they actually presented a 767 at the gate, we had further delays for 'new' onboard maintenance issues. In my last flight in late June, they boarded everyone, then said they had another 'minor' maintenance issue, then 45 minutes later, they deboarded everyone and sent us to a new gate. We had to wait there for yet another 767 to arrive and then once it did and we boarded - guess what - it too had maintenance issues and were further delayed. Final tally - 2 planes and five hours late to Miami, a full day of travel to cover what is a scheduled 2 1/2 hour flight, 8.20am departure arrived 6.00pm. Anyone who was unlucky enough to have connections out of MIA, which many people do, lost a full day of their vacation or business plans. I generally like flying jumbo jets, but if AA cannot properly maintain their 767s, then they clearly should not schedule them. I will no longer book any AA 767 service as I have completely lost confidence in what I had previously regarded as a top airline, to be able to provide anything close to reliable, ""on time"" service.";NEGATIVE

My final flight to Columbus was then delayed 3 hours. Instead of getting home at 5.20 pm like originally planned, I didn't get home until 1.01 am. To top it off, I had paid for a window seat on two of the planes, and was denied both this seat option and a reimbursement for it.

Finally they required all passengers to get off and find other flights. This entire ordeal caused many people to miss connecting flights, all of which could've been avoided from the start. AA did not offer any extra perks for this inconvenience - not even a drink service while sitting on the plane for 3.5 hours. Highly disappointed. They also could've had us get off earlier so we could possibly find earlier flights. One member of staff was set to reschedule 100+ flights for everyone on the plane.

Seat width was more than the rumoured sardine can and seat pitch was generous for a narrow body plane. Slimline seats didn't bother me much. it was pretty comfortable. Pretzel and beverages were served, which is awesome as some other airlines charge these. Cabin crew generous and enthusiastic as they made sure everyone got the beverages they wanted and offered a second one when asked. Flight circled over Atlantic City for 40 minutes as a result of severe weather hitting Reagan Airport. 2 rounds of trash-collecting service offered during the circling. There were connexting passengers onboard and flight attendants offered to check flight status for them. Lnded an hour late and got held on the ground for another 30 minutes because of gate issues.

Got a good deal on the flight using miles, but if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is. This class of service should be called enhanced business class, at best. The seats are a bit narrow given the armrests, and hard as bricks. No duvet or other cover to make them into a real bed. They just lie flat. There's also one small pillow. No small light by your seat: if you want a reading light there's only intrusive spotlights in the ceiling panel. 2-together middle seats don't seem to have a partition that rises, which would give you sleeping privacy from a stranger. The bathroom showed a lot of use, with lots of tape and old tape remnants holding in place the toilet. Zero amenities in there, too. There were several lotions in a Cole Hann travel kit by your seat, but not one disposable razor nor shave cream nor comb. Dining was similar. Large portions, but bean counters were again counting. A salad with breakfast had lettuce and two halves of one (yes, one) cherry tomato. Nothing else, not a sliver of a olive nor a shred of onion. And for breakfast forget getting salt and pepper shakers and just rip open a paper packet. There's also no drink cart (a nice way to discourage consumption) and the wines were mostly the sort you find in upscale grocery stores. Stag's Leap is the Chardonnay and one of the reds is Montepulciano d'Abruzzo (not to be confused with the fine reds from Montepulciano in Tuscany). Service was spotty. My wife and I were together but I seemed to get dinner service about 10 minutes before her. And collecting headsets an hour before landing only accommodates the crew. There's nothing wrong with all this, since it is serviceable, just like economy motels. But if you're paying for something special, is it too much to expect something special? And if airlines are competing for higher-priced international travel, could American just loosen its purse-strings by, say, $99 a passenger in first class? It might make a real difference.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-06-24;"American uses dubious business practices when booking tickets. I booked tickets for a family of 4 weeks before the flight date. There were no available seats at the time except for the upgraded seats at premium prices. I checked daily for a month and no seats opened. I hoped to get seats when we got to the airport. When I checked in online 24 hours pre-flight, I checked seats again. Surprisingly there were 42 empty aisles and window seats now available. American wanted to sell out the middle seats first, then make you pay extra for an upgraded seat rather than make all the empty seats available. We got 2 aisle seats and 2 window seats in the same row. The plane was extremely small and the seats were closer together with less legroom than any of the other 7 carriers I've flown domestically this year - by a lot. When the seat in front of me reclined I had no room to read my iPad without propping it on the top of the seatback in front of me. This made for a very unpleasant flight. Further - all the cabin overhead lights were turned off for the entire flight. It was a red eye but there was no option to turn a light on if you wanted to. Whenever a passenger opened a window blind they were told by the flight crew to close it. This was supposedly to allow people to sleep (because nobody sleeps on day flights obviously) but in effect it minimized the work the cabin crew had to do since everyone was relegated to darkness and had little reason to ask for anything from them. The worst airline and the worst flight I've ever taken is an impressive one-two punch. Avoid American at all costs. I'll never fly them again.";NEGATIVE

My wife, 13 year old daughter, 10 year old son and I were traveling from Barcelona to Philadelphia then from there to Los Angeles. In Barcelona we had a delay for 2 hours (sat in the airplane after boarding for 2 hours) therefore we missed our flight to LAX. In Philadelphia we were given new boarding passes for our flight to LAX. We got 4 seats in four different locations. When we asked the customer service agent at the boarding desk to change our seats to sit us together, she was so rude and unprofessional indicating the flight was full and she was not able to do so. This was incorrect because while we were waiting we noticed she was selling tickets to other people for the same flight as ours. I had to fight for them to rearrange our seats so that one parent sit with one child. It looks like they did not care about our concerns for our children sitting between two strangers in 6 hours night flight from coast to coast.";NEGATIVE

On the return flight home, yet another delay in North Carolina caused me to miss my connection. Another delay in Phoenix occurred and both were due to the fact the aircraft departing had not arrived.

We actually queued for 1.5 hours to resolve the issue. In total 2.5 hours to check 4 bags was ridiculous and the staff who were obvioulsy under pressure and disgruntled were very unhelpful. A lack of information all round meant that people were missing flights through no fault of their own. If this is new technolgy you expect problems but you resource it properly and American Airlines don't. The staff told me this happens every day - an abdication of responsibility by management then. By the time I got through security it was nailed on I will never fly with American Airlines again. Not to mention the standard of plane used across the Atlantic or my previous flight the week before from San Francisco to Philadelphia where I encountered the rudest crew I ever had the misfortune to be served by.

Also interesting is how it moves around. But the video selection is truly poor and lacking in selection. The worse for me was the service. Truly pathetic. I had the only lady flight attendant in First Class. She was rude and nasty from the beginning. At one point I was having trouble opening the tray table. She uttered in anger ""it takes more strength"". She put the tray with food on my lap, angrily opened the table and left, leaving the food on my lap. Passengers traveling in this class pay a lot of money and the least they deserve is a little respect from those whose job it is to make them feel comfortable. It got so bad that I avoided her the rest of the flight. I have never been treated so rudely, not even on budget carriers. AA needs to train its staff better.";NEGATIVE

They disappeared. I had to go to the customer service counter. At Los Angeles there were 2, yes only 2 employees at the counter. I was surrounded by self-service kiosks that would not address my issue. The line was incredibly long. An employee told me to go outside to the curb and use the curbside service to check in. I approached the employee and asked if he could check us in. He could not give me a direct answer. He had a terrible attitude and was condescending and rude. When he finally looked up the reservation he said he could not check us in because there was a problem. We went back to the line and started over again. Finally at the counter we got checked in. On the plane things didn't get any better. The service was so bad. The passenger next to me was traveling with a young child seated across the aisle. We moved around so the child could be sitting with one of his parents. The passenger asked if he could have 2 tiny snacks. The flight attendant adamantly refused stating only 1 was allowed. The passenger on my right asked the attendant if she could take her cup of water away. The attendant said - ""I can't do that right now"" and never returned. Granted these are minor issues but the attitude of every single employee was so rude. This is a service industry. There are so many choices. This was by far the worst choice I have made. I booked 5 tickets and selected seats. My seat assignment disappeared and we were randomly seated. This was the beginning of a very unpleasant flight. We have a reasonable expectation that as paying customers we will treated pleasantly. Never again.";NEGATIVE

Cabin attendants were very attentive. The business class seats are angled and lie down fully flat through I did not take advantage of this feature on such a short flight - the touch controls were easy to use. The selection of movies and TV fare was good enough - ""disposable"" headsets were provided on request. My seat faced the plane's rear and with the seats being angled the passenger across the aisle (whose seat faced the front of the plane) was directly in my sight line. This was a bit intrusive and disconcerting as each of us could see what we were doing throughout the flight.

This new plane had a faulty cockpit seat so now we're blessed with another 2 hour wait. Could have been home 2 hours ago now. Great service!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-06-17;" |  We booked a vacation via Travelocity in early March for this June. About three weeks later, we get an email saying that our flight has been changed to leave three hours and a half hours earlier, creating a 4 hour layover in Dallas before heading to our real destination of Cozumel. They also changed our return flight to arrive at a completely different airport on the opposite side of the city (about an hour away). This flight also included more layover time. I tried to check in online the night before our flight and checked my bags. I wanted to make sure that we could get in and on the plane quickly and easily. This is the best way to travel through any other airlines I've been on. Not so with American Airlines. It was upon checking in and checking my bags and feeling this great relief that a few minutes later I get the dreaded email - they changed our flight again, just hours before our flight. This time they added another 2 hours layover in Dallas making it a 6 hour layover and it's leaving two hours earlier. We were already booked on a dawn flight. Please keep in mind that flying directly to Cozumel from Houston is only 2 hours total. Since we are flying this airline, we are flying first to a more northern location to wait more than half a day and then back south to our final destination. We arrive at the airport without any sleep because they didn't tell us until 9 pm that they were changing our flight to 5:10 AM. The airport is an hour from our house and this is an international flight, so we had to leave our house by 2 am to get there on time for customs. We actually decided to leave even earlier since we couldn't sleep anyway and got to the airport by 2:30 AM. This is two hours and forty minutes before our flight and there is no one at the ticketing booth. In fact, they had a long line and all the passengers were worried about missing their flights. No one came to the booth until just past 3 am and still took on average 25 minutes for each group of travelers. We didn't get to security until about 50 minutes before our flight and they almost didn't let us on. In fact, one of the security ladies chewed me out because I was feeling antsy and worried about making my flight. She barked that I should have gotten to to the airport well before my flight. I was. It was American Airlines fault for not being at their ticketing booth on time, nor having enough agents to check in their passengers. They are the ones who moved our flight to the middle of the night without our permission, and without any options to change this. It's not our fault they don't have staff to deal with these changes they inflict on their clients.  I am actually on the plane and I am going to try to move past how upsetting this whole experience is and that I will waste a full day of my vacation without any sleep and stuck in an airport north of my destination and departing city. The only thing that gives me peace of mind in all of this is that there are other options/airlines in the future because I will never fly with them again after my return flight, which I pray they don't screw up too. We leave tomorrow afternoon for home on this airline. All of this and they charged us baggage fees when I originally checked in online and then charged again when we checked in at the airport because American Airlines had to modify our return flight. They have yet to reimburse for the duplicate charges.";NEGATIVE

On-time take off and 3:40 min flying time. Served drinks and nuts, a nice lunch with chicken-breast and salad, dessert and veggies. Pretty tasty. The inflight entertainment was overhead screens with some generic movie and NBC shows - not the best but most people were using wifi or their own devices.

For that leg I had to fly American. It began with delay after delay, enough to make me miss my connection and be told I would be stranded in Dallas until the following day, no explanation given and staff showed no interest. Finally landed in Dallas after an hour delay to find there is no plane for my connecting flight anyway. Constant gate changes and finally after a 3 hour wait we departed on a dirty plane with damaged seats.

Since the flight left from the old US Airways terminal in Boston the Admirals lounge was an old US Airways lounge, pleasant, but not overly comfortable. On board staff very pleasant and attentive. A brief stay at the Admirals Club (again, old US Airways) lounge in Charlotte with only oatmeal and breads provided. The flight to St Louis was on a new A319. I will admit that after reading other reviews of that plane I was a bit dubious but in fact found the small (8 seat) first class cabin quite comfortable.

My family and I were returning home from my niece's graduation and my son had school the following day. The flight number was 4266 and it was scheduled to leave JAX at 5.20pm and arrive at ORD at 7.09pm. About a month later Expedia called and stated that American had dropped that flight and we would need to reschedule. The only available flights that would get us home at a decent hour was to go from JAX to CLT (Charlotte, NC) at 4.54pm-6.15pm and then CLT to ORD at 7.05-9.14pm. Certainly not what I wanted, but better than nothing. This was all for a flight on May 23rd, 2016. We arrived at the airport about 2.30pm and proceeded to our gate. So much for the long security line. Sometime after that, we received an alert from Expedia that our flight was delayed by 30 minutes. About 5 minutes later, Expedia alerted us that our flight was now an hour late. Still nothing from American even though they had my email, phone number and I had the American Airline app on my phone all setup for alerts. About 5 minutes after the second Expedia alert American finally sent an alert via phone call that our flight was 30 minutes late. That was the only notice we received from American outside of the announcements at the gate that did not start until later. I knew we would miss our connecting flight so I went to the gate to inquire about a later flight from CLT to ORD. I was informed that they automatically pushed us back to the 10.35 flight from CLT to ORD. Nice to have a seat but where was the notification? Not to mention that the flight was not schedule to land at ORD until 11.44pm. A little late for my son to be out on a school night. I was also told by the person working the gate that my original direct flight was being put back on the schedule in June. Very nice of her to point that out, especially when it didn't help me at the time. Or maybe I could have just stayed at the airport another few weeks. Our flight out of JAX ended up 2 1/2 hours late giving us enough time to get to the gate in CLT with about 15 minutes to spare. Thank goodness we had carry-ons only. Our flight to ORD was slightly delayed but not too bad. The flight attendant forgot to offer my wife and I our complimentary beverage during service. I had to ask her for a drink and she seemed put off that I did so. I called customer service to complain as I had paid a premium originally for a direct flight, was bumped to a cheaper flight and was now bumped again to an even cheaper flight. They said they could not help me and I needed to send an email to customer relations. So I did explaining exactly what happened and how I was now also going to need to spend money on a meal at the airport that I did not plan to do. And we all know those are not cheap.

Though things looked clear down below, we circled for an hour and a half before being diverted to Greensboro to wait out the storm. From there, however, we were delayed another two hours waiting on fuel and gate accessibility and just general disorder in an airport clearly ill equipped to deal with the diversion. By the time we made it back to Charlotte, there were too many planes there to get anyone who was even close to making their connection into the airport - at this point what was meant to be a 2 hour flight had taken 5.5 hours. Stood in a never-ending line waiting for rude customer service and spent the night sleeping on Reagan-era chairs. The next morning we were treated like second class citizens, shuttled from gate to gate waiting on standby flights like we were looking for a handout and hadn't paid a hefty price to book in the first place. It's one thing to have weather impact the flight experience. that's no one's fault. But to treat paying customers like they're an inconvenience to the airline and previously ticketed passengers the following morning is unacceptable.

I had the chicken. and it was good as far as airline food goes. The bread, cheese, salad and brownie that went along with it were also good. A nicely varied meal. Drinks, including beer and wine were complimentary. Unfortunately all they had for beer was Budweiser but what else can you expect from AA? This was a good crew. No fake smiles - they were just regular people treating me like a regular person. Efficient, and I felt completely safe with them. Entertainment was great. Screens were big enough, and the picture quality was good. Good selection of movies, from new blockbusters to old classics. The complimentary earbuds were actually good, considering they were free. The flight did have WiFi on board, but I couldn't get it to connect. Don't know if it was because of the connection or my device. I would fly with AA again, and I am fairly certain that I will soon. I am giving this review a 10, based on my own experience. Out of all long haul flights I have made personally, I enjoyed AA the most.";POSITIVE

Boarding started at 9.15pm, at 9.30pm there was no more room for carry-on luggage and they asked everyone to check their carry-on luggage in. I was carrying my camera and very fragile items in my bag, however I couldn't take this onboard with me while they let some people board with more than 1 carry-on. They were talking to people like a flock of sheep. One was shouting at a lady ""Hey, pink T-shirt, boarding pass!"" No apologies for the inconvenience they were putting us through. The worst thing was that they had nothing to eat for a 5 hour flight, no sandwiches or salads, only cheese. The entertainment on board - I have no words to describe it. The free movies were from the 90's, if you want to watch the latest releases you have to pay $7.99 per movie. ";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-05-29;" |  I fly very regularly within the US for business and almost always use Alaska. This time I had to opt out with flying American Airlines on the way back to Seattle from Philadelphia and it was the worst travel experience I have had in years. In Philadelphia: the flight was overbooked. The plane was old, but my seats were okay because I paid extra for preferred seats and sat in the front area. Once onboard, it turned out that there was an issue with their A/C. At first we were told it would take a ""few minutes"", 15-20 min later, this was extended to ""30 min, at best"". After over an hour we were told this may take up to 2 hours and another 10 mins later finally asked to deplane. I had a connecting flight in Chicago following a layover of just over 2 hours - which meant that the connection was no more. After talking to the gate agent I was put on a new connection, from Philly to Charlotte and then to Seattle. Of course, my careful seat selection that I did during booking was gone. The plane I then got onto was old, seats old and cramped so tightly together I couldn't even sit straight. I could not reach anywhere once the table was unfolded. I sat in the very back, center seat, all of which was the opposite of what I had paid money for so that I would not have to endure it. Suffice to say: this flight again was delayed, over half an hour. Finally in Charlotte, off to the next flight: pretty much the same thing, except that this one at least had wifi. However, since American Airlines does like to overbook their flights they now collected my carry on because all overheads were full, although I told them I was already late and needed to run once we arrived in Seattle. To no avail, customers needs don't matter. And of course it left delayed. We landed at 8.42 and the baggage claim carousel started running at 9.21 - nearly 40 minutes. I finally had my carry-on back and it was past 9.30. ";NEGATIVE

So I arrived early only to discover that I could have been put on a standby list. I did not get on the earlier flights because so many others were already on the standby list and the 11.30 was nearly an hour late. I had to check my bag at the gate (not for gate pickup though) because, even though I am a relatively frequent flyer, had been delayed 5 hours, I was given last boarding priority. I am a patient person, but the complete lack of empathy about a situation that was causing a hardship really needs attention.

I called back again, they said they don't know if it will be more delayed and I will not be able to make it to the flight to UK. So I said, I want to canceled the tickets. They said, this number can only rebook your ticket. If you needed to cancel the ticket, you need to talk to ticket department. The ticket department transferred me to vacation department. No one can solve my problem. They just want the money from my pocket. I said I want to file a complaint, they said they don't have a number for complaints, I can only email! I said I want to talk to someone for refund, again, I can only email!  And I just checked my flight status. It was on time. So they just rebooked me for no reason.

When I said I didn't see one in the seat pocket, he said ""look again and get back to me"" and then left - I didn't see him again for the rest of the flight. The woman serving drinks was noticeably annoyed that I asked for coffee and orange juice. The seats were uncomfortable, the whole thing was pretty awful. I'd have to say that out of all of the airlines I've been on, and there have been quite a few, American Airlines is the WORST. I won't be using them again. You shouldn't either.";NEGATIVE

In all our years of travel neither of us had ever experienced anything like our flight out of Saint Martin yesterday. We booked a direct flight that left at 2:40PM and was to land in Philadelphia at 7:13PM. When we boarded the plane we were told we would arrive in Philadelphia early and were very pleased by this news. However, after a short time the pilot told us that there was something wrong with the plane. ""Something"" with no further detail as to what was wrong or how long it would take to repair. After 2 hours of waiting in the plane, we were told that the plane was repaired and would be able to fly. The pilot informed us however that due to ""legal issues"" we would not be able to fly to Philadelphia as planned, which was an estimated 4 hours and 35 minutes, instead we would be flying to Miami a 3 hour and 15 minute flight. We were not told anything other than that. We were then given the option to leave the plane but were told we would not be provided a room. About 40 minutes later we took off for Miami. We landed in Miami and waited on the tarmac for over an hour. Were told that we would be greeted by individuals who would tell us where to go and would take us step by step through customs and our return to the 10:30 flight from Miami to PHL. There was no one there to greet us when we arrived and no one to direct us through customs and security. We went through customs and were required to go through TSA security, despite not leaving the airport or having time to purchase anything. Once we arrived at our flight we were delayed in boarding and did not take off until after 11:30. We arrived in Philadelphia at around 2:00 and there was no one from AA to greet us or speak to. We waited, as a group, for our luggage for over 45 minutes before it began to come out. I am extremely disappointed with how disorganized and unapologetic this airline was.

Today I had my liquids bag in the front pocket which was making it bulge a bit and when getting ready to board was told it would not fit in the overhead bin I would have to check it. I tried to ask the agent if I could put my liquids bag in the main compartment and they said that it still wouldn't meet the size requirements, that I would have to check it. I showed them that it would fit but they still forced me to check my bag. The flight itself was average, they don't have individual seat TV screens so you were forced to watch poor movies and re-runs of NBC shows such as Chicago Fire, The Tonight Show etc with a ton of commercials which was very bad for a 7 hour flight. The seats were very uncomfortable and we were packed in, any other international economy flight I have taken this was not the case.

Not only did AA have ceiling screens, their choice of movies was abysmal. The food going was ok however coming home the food was terrible and in fact inedible.

Once on the plane my daughter was freezing cold so we asked for a blanket and we were told in an annoyed manner that we should have bought a jacket and there were no blankets. I've never been spoken to in such a nasty manner on an airplane in my life, I thought I must have caught a hostess having a bad day so I walked to the galley and asked another staff member and she said the same thing. When we disembarked we passed a few seats with cushions and blankets. I really don't know why the staff were being so unpleasant, we are not demanding passengers at all, infact we only had a glass of water on the whole flight as we planned to eat at JFK before our flight back to London on BA and my goodness what a difference in attitude from the BA staff, they were absolutely lovely.";NEGATIVE

Also, the flight was half empty with at least 20 empty seats so I do not understand why I was forced to check in my small suitcase.

The counter staff did not mind doing that, so with my boarding pass in hand I asked her fellow co-worker to show me a garbage disposal for my bags. He was completly shocked and did not allow me to leave without my bags. He charged me $25.00 and I am on my way home!

The inservice video was not working from my seat with nothing that could be done. On the return flight a week later, another lazy crew was on board. At one point I went to use the lavatory at the rear of the plane and both crew members were sitting in their seats in the last row of the plane talking.

My most recent trip, the hard product was okay, the seat was comfortable and that was about it. The AVOD system is old, slow, low resolution with a tiny screen. The choice of movies is very limited. Even bearing that in mind, this can be made up for in service. I found the flight crew to be indifferent, the service below average and the attitude seemed to be we were a constant inconvenience preventing them from being able to get back to the socializing at the front of the cabin. I am a very, very low maintenance flyer, but I found even the basics were missed. On the outbound leg, I wasn't even offered a drink at boarding! This is in International First Class. Food choices weren't available from the menu (I was in 2J) and I get the distinct impression that most people on the flight were on FF upgrades as opposed to paying pax. On the return flight, an AA employee (non flight crew) was sitting across from me - he was attentively taken care of, chatted to, given menus/drinks/turn down etc. The Airline is in trouble when it takes care of employees over premium passengers paying thousands of dollars for a seat. Aircraft is getting really old, this was a B777-200, and the interior was probably late 90's or early 2000's. Other than the large seats, everything was to a lower fit, finish and equipment level than an Alaska B737 in economy! There is not excuse for this, in fact, the AA A320 on the connecting flight to Seattle was way better with USB ports, power and a really nice big hi res AVOD system. Delta flies old airplanes too, but their interiors are bang up to date. There was not even a standard 110V power outlet - in First Class! It's hard to be a repeat customer, AA has been good in the past, but they are now firmly in the United Airlines category for me, they don't seem to be too bothered about earning my dollars.

When I approached the gate (at 9:15), the gate worker asked aloud if anyone was next and after I said that I was on the flight he responded very rudely ""too late, go rebook at the rebooking station"" and as he said that he printed out a boarding pass and handed it to a girl who was on stand by with her boy friend, also on stand by. So he basically did not want to undo what he had just done, which was give my seat away when I got there when I was supposed to be. The lady at the rebooking station then tried to charge me to rebook for something that was not my fault! I was stuck in Miami for over 12 hours, missed my shift at work and my classes. After contacting customer relations about the situation, they told me that it was my fault because I did not get to the gate to check in 30 minutes prior (which would have to have been 8:59 pm, when my first flight was landing).  Not only that, but not once did I hear them paging me over head to ""recheck"" or for their last call. After not getting a response back for weeks I decided to call again, the customer service rep then told me that the connecting flight that they had scheduled was in reality not a legal connection because it was set to depart less than 30 minutes after I arrived, that they cannot be less than 45 minutes. Which if that were the case, I would have gotten there in their ""30 minutes policy"" time frame.  After sending yet another email asking to be contacted by a superior by phone, I received another email saying that there is nothing they can do. They say they try their best to resolve any issues the best they can, but when they are at fault for something, cannot even admit it nor actually resolve the issue. ";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-04-18;" |  I am baffled at how unprofessional the entire American Airlines staff was at LAX. I was dropping off my parents at LAX We arrived at the airport around 10:30. We went in and used the check-in kiosk (but the kiosk said our confirmation number was incorrect) We decided to wait in line. Once we noticed that the kiosk assistance was free, my father asked for help but was surprised to receive a rude response from the staff member who rolled their eyes and proceeded to walk away. At that time we decided to continue to wait in line to speak with the check-in staff. My father even helped a single mother who was next in line who was clearly having difficulties with putting her luggage on the scale. We noticed that no one from the staff was helping her and seeing that she an infant strapped to the front he decided to step in. At this this point it was 10:50pm and we were getting anxious about missing our flight and going through security. So I took the initiative to walk up patiently to the desk. and was told final boarding was completed and that no other passengers were able to board. However after calling corporate head quarters, once we got home, we learn that final boarding time was actually 15 min prior to the flight time. The desk person told me to rush to ticketing to see if there was a connecting flight to get to our airport in Orlando. When we got to ticketing, we noticed that there were barely anyone in line, but the staff had no urgency or professionalism toward the waiting passengers/customers that needed help. There were only two customers in front of me. This is ridiculous in terms of manpower to customers, as there were 6 American Airlines staff members. I waited 15 minutes in line patiently. During this time, I saw an AA staff member who was easily identifiable. She just finished up with a customer. I waited a few minutes to wait for her to flag the next customer. She didn’t flag the next person (me), but instead was talking casually to the other staff members. So I walked up and waited to be addressed since she was talking. I did not say a single word or interrupt. She looked up at me and said in the most rude condescending disrespectful tone, that they weren’t ready. So I said back, “excuse me I didn’t even say anything to you”. Four other staff members who were free proceeded to talk and chat amongst each other. At this time, there were 7 parties behind us who needed assistance. I was finally helped around 11:10. ";NEGATIVE

Seat on the Boeing 767 was poor, I am a skinny person, and the seat and legroom was horrible for a 7 hour flight. The food was ok, I had a salad for 12 bucks. When we landed in Dallas, we tried to go to a kiosk in the airside, where you can print a boarding pass you didn't recieve at check-in, or so it said. We weren't able to print the boarding pass because American and US Airways were still in the process of merging, but both planes were painted in the American Airlines livery. When we went to the gate, luckily DFW Airport has the sky train, that's a plus, the gate agent refused to give us our boarding pass, so I had to show him the confirmation e-mail. We were the last passengers onboard, there was no overhead baggage space, so we had to go back to the gate agent to have our bags gate checked to Philly. Luckily, I slept throughout this entire flight. Landed in Philly, everything was ok, got our checked bags, and left. Never again will fly on American.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-04-16;"Salt Lake City to Knoxville via Chicago with American Airlines. Half way through boarding the first flight everyone was removed from the plane. It took the agent 25 minutes to tell the passengers any information as to what was going on. Mechanical problems. We sat for at least an hour before anything else was said. We were told to come to the counter and schedule another flight if we wanted. After standing in line for 45 min we were then handed a 1 800 number to call to reschedule. When I was near completed doing this they said the flight was canceled, we would have to go collect our luggage at the baggage claim, and go through the ticket counter to then get our new boarding passes. The 1800 agent had me scheduled, but it automatically canceled that one and scheduled me on another flight - 1 hour from then. I rushed to collect my bags and at the ticket counter the agent was not concerned about my troubles. The new schedule delayed my arrival by a day and I would have to stay in Chicago over night after arriving at 11 pm. When I asked she told me she didn't see where 'they' were giving any vouchers for food or overnight stay. Also, despite the long security line she wouldn't get me a 'prescreen' pass to get through security quicker. She said 'you have plenty of time.' Well, I did make it, with 3 minutes to spare. She was so right. I was routed through Dallas where I asked the agent there if I would be given a food and/or overnight voucher. She said I would have to check in Chicago, she couldn't help me. Upon arrival in Chicago the airport was almost empty except for a gate where they were about to load a plane. There were 4 agents standing at the counter talking (ie. doing nothing), so I asked one what I needed to do about staying in Chicago and is American Airlines going to give me a voucher. She said 'she was busy having to get ready to load a plane' and gave me another 1800 number to call or I could go down to the service center, which is a collection of phones, but no agents. I decided to consider it a complete loss. It was now almost midnight so I walked to the Airport Hilton, paid for a room, and left the next morning with yet another delay. Since then I have heard similar stories about American. I don't think I will be flying with them again. Customer service couldn't have been worse.";NEGATIVE

They re-routed me which meant not having the 3 hour layover in Phoenix in which I planned to see my brother and his sons. I was not compensated in anyway. When I booked the flight I had to change it and pay $108 but when they mess up my flights there is no compensation. My business in LA concluded earlier than planned and I wanted to get back earlier, they refused to waive a change flight fee for me saying they cannot do it and they told me they do not permit standby either. I took pictures of the disgusting condition of the plane I flew back on - the seat back flaps were peeling away from the seats, it was desheviled and gross. None of the entertainment options or free snacks they boasted about in their in-flight magazine ever occurred. Their employees were the most unprofessional I have ever experienced they never addressed me professionally (ma'am) they were unapologetic and they were irritated at me for expecting to be serviced professionally.

Most recently, an AA flight canceled due to a crew member not showing up. I was placed on another flight the following day that had additional layovers because that was ""all that was available."" I was not in my home city so the AA agents gave me a voucher for $150 for cab fair/hotel but when I tried to use it, I was told I needed to pay out of pocket and contact AA Customer relations to get reimbursed. There is no phone number for AA Customer Relations (apparently they do not have phones), only email. I never got an email response and was never reimbursed. And, as if that is not frustrating enough, because I was added late to the alternate flight, I was the last to board, we somehow ran out of overhead space (on two separate flights) and they had to check my small (18"" round) carry-on. I pleaded with the flight attendant to let me keep it because it had valuable/fragile gifts in it but she insisted and it broke. I will never fly AA again. Not just because their customer service is terrible, it is literally non-existent.";NEGATIVE

They cram us in these small seats to fit more of us in there. My flight was delayed, a connection that was supposed to be from Phoenix to Seattle. The reason for delay was ""maintenance"". The purpose of this trip was for me to make it to a meeting. No point now I suppose. Customer service could have made it better with an apology but instead he told me there is nothing that could be done. ";NEGATIVE

This is real member benefit (I am One World Sapphire) and will bring me back to AA if there is a flight. This was not an upgrade due to a full flight, add to the fact that the flight was not full, it was a rather comfortable flight having paid an economy fare. The flight time is some 8 hrs and I arrived feeling refreshed. Completing the four segments CDG-NYC-EZE completely changed my misconception on AA and I shall be their customer if I fly EY.";POSITIVE

Again I had a Premium Economy seat paying EY fare and it was quite comfortable, again I say thanks to AA for such member benefits. I think other One World partners should learn to do the same rather than pricing themselves out of the so-called Premium Economy class. Service was normal and efficient. Airport check-in and facilities and Club lounge at EZE are not as good as at NYC though.";POSITIVE

Check in at JFK was a delight, as AA has a special area for elite member to check in. The check-in service was excellent and I was treated like a VIP. Good that they print benefits such as Priority Boarding on the boarding pass, rather than the passenger having to show a card at the gate. As with the last segment I was able to get a seat that some 'partner airlines' called Premium Economy at no cost. The flight is long and a bit tiring, but what more can I ask with a PE seat that offers good space at my price?";POSITIVE

When booking I had reservations as to the standard of service etc but all doubts proved to be misconceptions with regard to American service. From check in, as a One World Sapphire member, I was allowed to change seats to what other airlines called Premium Economy seats without further charge (AA do not operate a Premium E service but charge extra for these seats), great that as a One World Premium member I had this benefit. This is more than enough that in future I will opt to fly AA above my 'home airline' CX or BA that I fly with often. ";POSITIVE

The seats do not recline back at all despite having a button that is supposed to allow you to do so and all the flight attendants tell you to put your seats in the upright position. The arm rests are so hard, if you are a taller than average person be prepared to have a very uncomfortable flight. You can't stretch your feet out, your knees touch the other person's seat, you will be sitting up straight for the whole flight. Make sure to dress warmly as they like to keep you frozen during the flight as popsicles are less likely to walk around the cabin. They nickel and dime you to the point that it would have been cheaper to go with the more expensive airlines. I have a global entry card which is usually good enough for TSA pre check in most airlines, but you have to pay for that ""convenience"". Want to check your bag? That will be $25. Two bags. $60. Want to pick your seat? $45+ depending on the seat. Want Internet? $6 for 30 minutes. Please note, I chose N/A for food and beverages and inflight entertainment since I didn't use these. They were available but I chose not to buy them. The 1 star for wifi connectivity is because the pricing was ridiculous. I will never fly this airlines again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-04-11;" |  First longhaul flight with American Airlines which I booked with BA under codeshare. I was disappointed to find that this particular Boeing 767 didn't have any seat back flight entertainment. Just an old and worn out cabin with original interior and seat, possibly that has not changed since it was put into service 20 years ago. The only entertainment was CRT screens in the middle aisles and a choice of music played in a loop from the arm rest, maybe this was acceptable 10 years ago but in 2016 you would expect the airline to provide a modern cabin. In fact the whole cabin was so old and tatty even those in first had to use tablets for entertainment, this is unacceptable when paying passengers expect some modernisation. For such a popular route from Chicago to London you would expect American Airlines to consider using a more modern aircraft, but no they obviously don't care what their customers might think of the airline. They can afford to buy dremaliners and 777's but don't bother updating their current fleet. The food was also pretty poor quality compared wo what I have been offered on BA in the past, but I don't expect fine dining on an economy ticket. The only positive were the nice cabin crew and flight crew, very friendly, nice to talk to and captain offered very useful information throughout the flight. In future I'll avoid this airline, certainly not worthy code sharing with BA.";NEGATIVE

Check-in at LHR was a bit of a nightmare but not sure who was at fault for the huge queue. Flight experience was overall good, seats are fairly comfortable being economy class. Inflight entertainment is on demand and plenty of films, games, music to chose from. Food was fine and more than abundant. Also plenty of drinks offered and before we arrived in Miami an ice-cream and a snack. However when I fly I care most about the safety of an airline rather than fancy food. Crew was fairly friendly, especially on the LHR-MIA leg and mature. Check in staff in Miami was helpful and friendly as for whatever reason I was unable to complete my online check in (think because it was ticketed by Iberia). Overall a very good experience.";POSITIVE

Decided to use electronic login terminals as we only had cabin baggage. Process was relatively straightforward and two documents were printed, however they did not have seat numbers on them but had instructions to proceed to gate where seat numbers would be allocated. Went through security and straight to gate, needless to say, there was no-one there becasue it was so early. Eventually about 10 minutes before boarding was due to start, one member of staff turned up so I got straight to the desk before anyone else to ensure that my wife and I could sit together on the long flight. I was then told that the flight was overbooked and that I would have to wait. Eventually another member of ground staff came up to the desk about five minutes before boarding was due to start (very harassed). Thankfully my name was called and we were able to get seats, but they were offering people 800 dollars to take another flight. There were many disgruntled people complaining about lack of information. Once boarded, we then had to wait for about an hour as they couldn't get one of the engines started! Actual flight was OK, but seat was very uncomfortable (I thought airline seats were all the same). Cabin crew did all that was required of them, but very disappointed in the ground staff, but maybe that's just the AA way of doing things! USA is a great country and the people are lovely, but you are so let down by your airlines and airports. Think we'll stay in Europe next year";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-04-10;" |  Chicago to Tokyo Narita with American Airlines. Surprisingly very pleasant experience with American, especially how many horrible stories you hear about US-based airlines. The aircraft was a relatively new Boeing 787, and the J class cabin was a spacious 1-2-1 layout in reverse herringbone. Went onboard and was greeted with warm nuts and welcome drink. There was an amenity kit by Cole Haan, but everything was made in China, even the lotions, which made the product simply feel very cheap and of poor quality. The seat is fully lie flat. It's somewhat comfortable, the only complaint is that when the person next to you moves, for some reason, you can feel it (and I suspect the other person can also feel when I move) The inflight entertainment system was very impressive. Not only was the screen very big, there was an flatscreen display to control the programme from the comfort of your seat. There is also an iPhone-sized control for manipulating your seat and adjusting it to any way you wish, very impressive technology! The meal service was good, and came very eloquently presented. The crew was friendly and welcoming. There was wifi service, but I did not try it as it was for a fee. Overall a good flight experience on American's new plane, would recommend it.";POSITIVE

american-airlines;2016-04-08;" |  I will never fly with American Airlines again after the fiasco I experienced 30 Mar. Due to leave Ontario, CA at 1005 am arriving PHX at 1114 am. When I checked in at 0800 flight was “on time.” Cleared security and proceeded to the departure gate. Around 0935 announcement made that flight was delayed and passengers with connecting flight prior to 1230 were to return to ticketing counter. My Atlanta connection was scheduled for 1236 so I stayed at the gate. A second announcement was made some time later and I realized there was no way I could make my connecting flight. There is no customer service available at the gate areas and I had to return to the ticketing counter which meant a second time through security. This certainly did not please me but I went back to the ticketing counter and stood in the line that provided ticket sales/customer service. During my 30 minute wait in line the clerk kept telling the customers they would be much quicker going to the other end of the counter. Finally, when the “other end of the counter” was free I moved over to it. The clerk told me she couldn’t help me and directed me back to the counter I had just moved from. I told her it was time American Airlines got their act together as “he” had just directed me to her counter for service. By then I was incensed but, moved back to the other line yet again. At no time did I hear any explanation for the two delays. By the time I got to the clerk I was not too receptive to her “resolutions.” She could reschedule me for the following day (I had already cleared my hotel and turned in my car). she could route me to Dallas/Ft Worth, Charlotte, Atlanta. she could route me to Dallas/Ft Worth, Atlanta. Both flights would get me to Atlanta around 1148 pm. I did ask about transferring to either Southwest or Delta but was told I could only transfer to “partner” airlines. If I wanted to go with another airline I would have to pay to do so. At that time I had no idea there was a bad storm impacting Dallas but I’m sure your staff were well aware of that fact. While not happy, I opted for the Dallas/Ft Worth, Atlanta flight. Went back through security for a second time and headed for the departure gate. Another announcement stated due to a bad storm in the Dallas area the flight was delayed. This delay meant I would miss the last shuttle from Atlanta. The coup de gras was my boarding passes were stamped for Group 4-----my seat numbers were 23A and 15C. I came to the conclusion that your clerk purposely placed me in the Group 4 boarding sequence to add a little more aggravation----retribution perhaps? I’m 78 years old and have traveled many, many times in the past 58 years both in the States and to other countries. The airlines have merged to the point that they now have a monopoly. Subsequently, they no longer have to be concerned about retaining their customers. They are making billions in profits with the fuel price as low as they are but you continue to gouge the customers at every point - $25 for early boarding, really? Who wants to sit on a plane any longer than they need to?  This is my second bad experience with American Airlines and it will be my last. I will certainly share my bad experiences with everyone I know that flies.";NEGATIVE

On approachong American Airlines flagship check in at Miami I was told by female employee to go 'over there' where the economy check-in was. I continued and asked her why did she assume I was not entitled to check in there. She said she had to make sure not everyone try to check in there as it was for First class passengers only. Well, I was travelling First and I am a BA Gold Card holder (Emerald in Oneworld) so I was doubly entitled to check in there. Very off-putting for an employee to do this. Worse was to come. The so-called First class is anything but First class, apart from the seat which was comfortable. No welcome. Pre-departure drinks were not cleared. Moody flight attendants. No hand cream in toilets. No breakfast worth having (only two quiches, the one I had was very bland and soggy). No bread was offered, just sweet cookies. I deliberately did not eat anything in the lounge hoping for a good First class breakfast. If I had brought a McDonald's meal I would have been more satisfied. Entertainment was a table. In 21st century America? Why do we pay so much money to travel with them if they offer so little? American is a rip off. They claim they are changing.

american-airlines;2016-04-06;" |  A red-eye flight from Las Vegas to Philadelphia with American Airlines. Flight was fully booked. All overhead storage was full, well before half the plane boarded. Our boarding group wasn't even called yet before they announced storage was full. This did cause boarding to take a lot longer than normal, as many people had to back track to check their bag with the front desk. The front desk continuously announced you could check your bag for free at the desk, due to the storage shortage, but it appeared most who were boarding ignored this. We gladly took them up on it, and dropped off our bags at the desk, well before everyone else finally realized they had no choice. This at least let us board quicker as everyone was now crowding the front desk. Desk crew was friendly enough, I think they were getting a bit annoyed despite multiple announcements that there would be no storage, that people were generally ignoring their calls. We flew economy, so seats were as expected. I'm quite tall, as is my wife, so it can be a bit uncomfortable with the small leg room after an hour or two. Knees not in the seat, but, not enough room to move them at all. So, if you are in the plus 6 foot range, and with a bad knee, can be a bit annoying, but, we realize you get what you pay for. Crew were friendly and pleasant enough, flight was mostly quite as it was leaving Vegas at 11pm and landing in Philly at 6. Napped most of the way, when I could, so nothing really to report. Flight was generally smooth and we arrived earlier than scheduled, so that's always nice. I only had a glass of water during the flight, so can't really comment on food/drink service, too much. I believe the Wifi on this flight however did not work. Disembarking was only troubled by other passengers. A middle-aged man near the back of the plane decided, rather than wait for the rows to ahead to disembark, he would just start pushing his way out, which caused people to get chippy.

Flew from Kona to Phoenix expecting an hour layover to Portland and when we land, we find out it's been changed to 4 hours. Mind you, a 6 hour flight with a screaming 1 year old plus being dragged through a 45 min process just to check bags because computers froze and then employees almost tagged our bags with the wrong tags.

I was about to ask if I could switch but the woman spoke to me as though I was a complete idiot. I only chose this seat because it was one of 2 seats available.

When I nervously stuttered that I didn't know what it meant she said, ""You know it's a responsibility to sit here, right? Maybe you should have a look at the pamphlet and familiarize yourself."" She didn't offer me another seat, she disdainfully informed me that I would ""have to be moved if I couldn't assist."" The gentleman next to me took pity on me and explained.

Coming back home, I arrived at the airport very early and noticed that no staff were there to give me a boarding pass. I decided to use a machine to check-in and I was concerned when my reservation was not found. Once the staff arrived, I was informed that my flight to Dallas was cancelled due to weather. I researched the weather conditions in Dallas and found out that there were indeed thunderstorms, but they were brief and many other flights were delayed (not cancelled). Since the delay was ""weather"" related, the airline did nothing to help (no food and no hotel) and they repeatedly lied to customers. They had me re-booked on flights that were two days later, but I fought hard (and spent hours) to get onto a LAN flight that got me home just one day late. The cancellation cost me a lot of time and money (for hotels, taxis, and food) and the staff and service on American was atrocious. I truly believe that airlines use weather as a loophole to cancel flights that have light loads (saving them money) without having to take responsibility! The only good thing about the cancellation was that I ended up getting to fly LAN Airlines to Miami. LAN provides more leg room, comfortable seats, delicious meals with wine, and their staff really seem to care about the passengers. American Airlines is a nasty behemoth of an airline and I recommend avoiding them (even if it means paying more for a competitor).";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-04-02;"My recent experience flying out of Oakland to Indianapolis via Phoenix has shown that American will stoop to incredible lows when trying to avoid FAA regulations regarding oversold flights. Our flight was oversold, and when they could not find enough people to take their vouchers, they announced a last minute delay. They didn’t follow any procedures for said delay. Their gate agents knew nothing and the flight information wasn’t updated until sometime after I had boarded. Once onboard, we were told the delay was due to a leaky coffee pot. I’m still at a loss as to what safety issues were at stake for this issue. The flight attendant wasn’t much better simply stating, ‘you wouldn’t water on the floor would you?’ Clearly there is a disconnect here, because missing a connecting flight over a little or even potentially a lot of water on the floor isn’t worth it, especially on a holiday weekend where my plans for the following day ended up completely ruined.  Myself and probably a dozen other people missed our connecting flights. In my case, I arrived at my gate just as my plane was pushing off. My destination wasn’t a hub, and the people managing this flight couldn’t wait five more minutes to allow myself and the other two passengers who arrived at the same time I did, the courtesy to board. The next flight was four hours later (on a red-eye), and for my inconvenience, I got a meal voucher that would only be able to pay for a fast food dinner. Running through Phoenix, my laptop bag managed to open up causing my laptop to fall out. My experience with AA customer service wasn’t much better. They don’t get back right away, and they refused to escalate this. To this day, I’m still trying to figure out how a leaky coffee pot presents any real safety issue worthy of grounding a flight, and customer service didn’t have a good reason for it either. I was offered a measly 10,000 bonus miles, worth nowhere near what the travel voucher I should have received for essentially being involuntarily bumped. That will get you (if you’re lucky) one third of a domestic ticket, and not at all worth the inconvenience that was forced on me and fellow passengers. At best, this was someone’s incompetence. At worst, this was an unethical way for an airline to save a few thousand dollars. If it has really come to something like this to make a few extra dollars, then perhaps it’s time for their customers to find an airline that respects them a bit more.";NEGATIVE

When the plane arrived after it was delayed I saw that it had new livery, I assumed it was a new plane - but to my surprise it was an old plane on the inside. Legroom was horrible you could barely move your legs. The only thing they offer is some complementary beverages, if you want anything to eat you have to pay for it.

The day before the flight they moved my wife and I to different seats on the plane, that weren't even close to each other. We had make our reservations 8 months ahead of time, I figured that flights can change last minute, and they must have overlooked this detail. I called them to make them aware of the problem. I sat on hold with them for over an hour, till the representative came back and said they couldn't do anything about it over the phone and I would have to go directly to the airport to fix the problem. But also assured me that there were plenty of seats left and not to worry. I didn't want to take a chance, so I went online to check in and paid an extra fee to upgrade our seat so that I could move them together. When we got to the airport, they had moved our seat again, and they were no longer together again. They told me the plane was full and they couldn't do anything about it. Nor would they refund the fee I paid earlier. I would of made more of a big deal about it, but there was a family of 5 with small children in front of me that they did this same thing to, with seats not near each other. Bottom line, if you don't mind getting separated from your travel group, and treated like your are just someone to fill a seat, then by all means book with American Airlines.

Rather unusual arrangement, with every other row facing backward, similar to BA except that the seats are at an angle, with full separation between middle row seats. Not much storage space, though. The crew however were unengaged bordering on rude, no interest shown to the passengers, mechanical, no smiles, one felt that they'd rather be anywhere else but on the plane. Food was quite a disappointment, as well, edible, but resembling canteen fare. IEE were a bright spot, screens large, sharp, HD, with tons of movies and variety of shows. Overall, a vast improvement from the old business class, but what makes a journey pleasant and enjoyable is the cabin crew, and once again America Airlines disappoints.

Considering AA now only has eight seats in the 1st class compartment of the Boeing 777-300, the two cabin staff assigned were more than sufficient. friendly and polite despite the harried nature of the boarding. Lunch served after reaching cruising altitude, starter, soup, and salad were very good. I wasn't very happy with the main course, considering the delay I probably should have chosen something other than beef. The flight attendant saw that I hadn't eaten anything she offered me another which was delicious. The inflight entertainment was great with hundreds of choices. The intercontinental WiFi took some adjusting but eventually worked just fine. My connecting flight was delayed for about an hour due to a mechanical part which needed replacing. Again on the short flight to St. Louis the cabin crew was friendly and very helpful with pre-flight offered immediately. Drinks were served promptly at cruising altitude and seconds were offered with a smile. Aside from the weather delay, not a bad experience at all.

The first and last leg were American Airlines the middle two legs were Cathay Pacific. While the AA planes were shiny and new and the business class was very comfortable, the level of service between the two carriers was night and day. It takes flying an airline like Cathay to realize just how much the service lacks at American. On Cathay I was personally greeted, asked if I required anything before takeover (and prior to landing), was given a large, clean, hot towel, had a very attentive flight crew that cared about my comfort and was always there to help and offer anything. On American Airlines I had a crew of people that clearly wanted to be anywhere else.  The warm towel was old and cold, the food was thrown at me as if it was a race to finish the meal service, when I asked for another water I was given the cold stare - the team just seemed mad and visibly demonstrated that they think their job sucks. I wish I could say this was a one-off, but I have noticed it more and more on my AA flights. Its sad and makes me not want to keep flying the 50-100K miles I fly each year on AA. Whatever happened to people having pride in their work? The last 6 AA flights I have been on have all had a problem of one sort or another - I notice the pilots having to apologize a lot.

My eldest daughter was to be married in Curacao, a destination wedding. After meticulous planning we arrived at JFK airport to find that our flight would be delayed. In that delay we learned we would miss our connector from Miami to Curacao. After being directed into three different lines, we were told nothing could be done and that we would not get connector flight out to Curacao via Miami till 1130 a.m. the next morning. (Almost 18 hours after our initial connecting time.) Crushed at the news of potentially missing the wedding, airline staff asked why we booked our connector like we did? As if it were our fault! Tears rolling down face I responded by asking ""why the offer a connection under 50 minutes if it can't be honored? Fast forward, we finally board our flight to Miami. Things seem to be going ok until we stay on the runway for 50 minutes. No explanation given. We finally take and arrive in Miami to find we cannot disembark because there is a broken plane in the way. Left with no patience and a $14 food voucher we schlep to our hotel. We missed many festivities that occurred during our delay that I can never recover. The unsympathetic staff that seems to be used to horror stories like mine, turned a deaf ear.

Make no mistake they hold back seats for elite members that most 'normal' families will not see as options. When I expressed my displeasure at being separated from members of my party they told me I should not expect to have three people seated together.

american-airlines;2016-03-08;"My wife and I decided to treat ourselves and fly business class to see our son in Raleigh. American Airlines business experience was almost laughable on the return journey. The flight out was OK but not anywhere near as good as other airlines. The return journey was abysmal. From surly check in which even my son commented on,to an ancient aircraft and inedible food. We assumed from all the advertising about the newly refitted planes we would enjoy a comfy flight. I checked in online the day before and looked at the seat plan to make sure it was the new configuration which it was. On boarding what a disappointment to find an ancient plane with the old seats and shabby interior. We have experienced these old planes before and our hearts sank. So much for a treat. The stewardess was in such a rush to serve my wife she skipped the nuts and gave her her starter immediately, before she was ready, her plate was whipped away and her entre plonked in its place. We had to laugh because we felt we were in a carry on film. What is it with American Airlines staff? They need some training as something is missing, and their customer service is dire. Sadly they have a monopoly on the Raleigh route. We will consider going another route next time on British Airways who are so much better. One good thing, the plane landed on time. Wake up, American and sample what other airlines are doing. If you must use ancient planes let the customer know in advance to save the disappointment on boarding.";NEGATIVE

But after backing away from the gate, the plane sat for what seemed like a long time with no explanation. Finally, Captain told everyone that the plane had a faulty ignition and would have to return to the gate for maintenance inspection. After telling everyone that repairs would take ""about a half hour"" he then came back and said delays would now be another hour. He let people unboard, which later resulted in further delays. By the time we took off we were two hours behind. Once again there was an unusually long delay between leaving the gate & getting off the ground. When we finally landed in Dallas, again another long delay getting to the gate. We missed our connecting flight by 5mins and had to wait 5 hrs from the next flight. We were bumped from row 14 to row 28. Never again will we fly American Airlines.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-03-07;"There is no doubt that American carriers in general lag behind their European, Middle Eastern and Asian counterparts in anything from service, equipment to entertainment. On my recent flight on American Airlines it came to a new low at least as far as entertainment is concerned. The available selection and more so the interface is not something I expected to see on a Boeing 777. The movie selection was minuscule, even compared to carriers such as United. The New release selection comprised a handful of features and most of them weren't even that new. The features are not ""on demand"" they have a cycle and you have to either watch what is in progress or wait for the next feature to start.  The food in general is mediocre but since my flight originated in London it is probably better than if I had started my trip in Miami. Generally speaking I find that the quality of food on US carriers is better coming out of Europe rather than arriving into.";NEGATIVE

I went to the AA information desk and they told me that the plane was on its way back Charlotte (which seemed like a very quick turn around and I highly doubt that AA is that efficient). I was told that I would be able to retrieve my phone at Charlotte Airport when I return. I did file a lost and found report with AA on their website and got a generated e-mail that stated I would have to contact the airport. A week later when I landed back in Charlotte I went straight to the AA counter in the baggage claim area. I explained about my phone and the first thing out of the girls mouth was that I would need to come back in the morning because her supervisor was not there. I told her that I lived 2 hours away and it was impossible to come back in the morning. She then proceeded to spend the next ten minutes going through the computer system and finally told me that she did not see a phone matching my description. I have called AA at Charlotte Airport and all you get is a recording stating to leave your information and IF the item is found they will call you back. There is no way of talking to a real person. Needless to say it has been almost two weeks and I have yet to hear anything.  If AA cannot even return a phone when given the exact information on where and when the phone was lost, I cannot imagine what they do with really expensive items that they retrieve from planes. Obviously they must make some money on these found items because I read after 90 days items are turned over to the City of Charlotte.";NEGATIVE

The plane was painted in the new livery, but don't let the new exterior deceive you. The interior of the plane was outdated, as the seats were very uncomfortable to sit in and looked like they were from the 1990s. The trays were difficult to fold back into place once you unfolded them, and some even had scratches and ink marks from over the years. The lavatories were showing their age and were disgusting. The only entertainment sources of entertainment you had were magazines, the window, and what you brought on the plane. They had TVs on the ceiling, but they only started playing a movie in the last hour or so of the flight. The cabin crew was the best part of the flight. They came around a few times with beverages and snacks, and they were dedicated to doing their job. There was barely any turbulence, which made the flight very smooth. The people on the ground were also nice, and boarding was organized. Overall, I would not recommend flying American Airlines.";NEGATIVE

No room in overhead bins and they checked our luggage. We got to the hotel at 2AM after waiting for baggage claim and a taxi. I could have driven to Texas quicker than this.

The Miami airport was the most miserable travel experience of my life. After spending a wekk at the wonderful W hotel, I was met with rude American Airline agents at every corner - from the bag check in, to security. Angry, rude, completely unprofessional. At bag check in we were met with 90 percent of the kiosks out of order. Then we were yelled at regarding proper protocol for checking bags as if guilty of something. Then without any direction to where our gate was we roamed the enormous airport without any guidance from our baggage check in. Upon arriving at the gate, the airline agent followed the airline consistency of rudeness reprimanding us for showing up only 20 minutes before the flight was departing, which was insane considering we still stood in line for 20 minutes to board the plane. Upon getting on the plane, I greeted the flight attentendant with ""how are you today"", only to be met with a deer in the headlights attitude of why was I even talking to her. Then to end this complete miserable experience, my luggage was lost. The luggage specialist told me the luggage was placed on the next flight rather than ours. We arrived at the airport 2 hours before out flight, I asked her why this had happened. Her response was I have no idea. I then asked if I would received some sort of credit for this inconvenience and my luggage being delivered within 5 days, which she said no we don't do that. The lack of professionalism at every corner was astonishing. I flew Jet blue recently and the flight was bumpy and they credited every passenger 50 dollars, they are a class act. American Airlines seems to have been reduced to a modern Peoples Express. I am sure the CEO gets a handsome salary, but frankly is not doing their job with having such chaos and poor customer service exist at every level through a passengers experience. Horrible experience which could have been easily avoided with some proper management in place, customer satisfaction protocol in place for errors made by the airline, rather than treating customers like cattle with complete disregard for a pleasant experience. Management of this company should be ashamed. People's airline reincarnate, shameful.";NEGATIVE

We refused and chose to drive to Chicago instead. The ground service at Indy was rude, nonchalant and not helpful at all, first they put us back on Economy class between ORD-LHR and afterwards they said there was overbooking on Business Class so there was no seat guaranteed. From Chicago everything was fine, we could not complain. The cherry on top of the cake was that the Charlotte to London flight they wanted us to take was also cancelled and never made it to London, so if we listened to the airline, we would have been stuck in the US for at least another day.

After more than an hour we had not been fed and later we were given a sandwich and bottled water and boarded . We taxied for takeoff where we sat for a period of time and captain reported the engine light had again appeared so we taxied back to the gate and sat until the 2nd mechanical problem had been resolved. The Captain told us that wet could not reach Roatan as the airport curfew for landing was past and we were flying back to Miami. We were told AA Customer Service would meet us and make the necessary arrangements for the night and the return flight the next morning. When we finished going through Immigration and Customs and baggage and we had GREAT difficulty finding the ONE AA Customer Service person who was extremely difficult to deal with in terms of the arrangements for the night and next morning. We learned that there were no hotel rooms available. He gave us a voucher for the 9AM flight the next morning, a $12 voucher for dinner @ 11.45 pm and we learned from other passengers that we were to go to the 4th floor to an auditorium. Upon arriving there we were provided with a folding cot, a blanket that was too small to cover anyone over 5'8” tall, the room was no more than 65 degrees and filled with people on cell phones, very tired and crying children, and chain saw snorers through the night. Upon checking in the next morning after an extremely uncomfortable night the counter people had no idea who we were and why we needed re-ticketing. Upon landing in Roatan, I learned a piece of my luggage was still in Miami It was necessary for me to go to the airport to pick it up. AA Customer Service in Roatan does not appear to exist, at least not for us!

As it turned out, we had to take a taxi and it took us more than 1.5 hrs to travel and we missed the flights as the American Airlines lady booked.

We landed on time in Philadelphia with a very brief connection. We got onto the next flight with very friendly Ground Staff, on time departure. There was sufficient service for the short two hour flight, drinks and snacks. No In-Flight entertainment but a very bad WiFi connectivity, if you tried to use the free edition.

If you choose to get a hotel, you can send in a copy of your receipt to get up to $75 off"" It was a nightmare - I was all alone and ended up sleeping on the airport floor. I don't know what the issue was (weather? mechanical?), and it seemed like many people were in my same situation. However, the staff just didn't care and were very dismissive. I'm disappointed in American Airlines for not communicating with me what my options were (this hasn't happened to me before), and I'm disappointed in the careless Charlotte airport staff. I've never been so exhausted in my life after gettinG 3hrs of sleep on a cold floor and then waiting hours for my flight, which was again delayed by 30 mins.

I was scheduled to depart from Fayetteville, NC with American Airlines - I asked the lady working at the front ticket counter if there were possibly any flights I could make out of Raleigh, which is an hour away.

Along with that there were also about 6 other flights available that day out of Raleigh. Even though the lady on the phone wasn't friendly at least she was patient and helpful. Sadly this isn't the end of my story, I ended up having a connection flight home, of course my first flight out of Raleigh was delayed so I had to run to the next gate.

This enlarged into needing to correct the paperwork for this weight problem and finally into having to burn off fuel to eliminate the extra weight. Overall confusing and seeming disorganized in the first place. Our last leg through Phoenix to ABQ was a true mess. We came in on an overnight flight from Honolulu with a connecting flight leaving at app. 9am for Abq. However, we were held in Phoenix until 2pm due to ""mechanical problems"" with our assigned plane. This plane was still in Austin, (or so the gate staff said but the Customer service staff office nearby said it had departed earlier). As we sat and waited one could hear constant AA gate changes followed by a rush of passengers to elsewhere. The question steaming through our passenger group was simply, is there not another aircraft available when such a thing happens? Will we need to hustle to squeeze on to the next scheduled fight to Abq? Shall we rent a car and drive? The stressed gate staff kept announcing new and later departure times with no other info available. Then suddenly (our) plane arrived and after waiting briefly for a co pilot we left app. 5 hours late. The impression left was one of being in a gritty country called AA where chaos, lack of information and customer service is casually routine and where shareholders and yet greater profits are really the primary goal.

The correct flight was the same price so it was a simple change. All went well and they agreed to change it no problems. (I thought) the correct flight was booked, and all was well. As I prepared for my trip, I realized my itinerary on aa.com was still the original flight. I call AA and they informed me that although they can see I called in, they have no record of the change. I explained that the reason I called (obviously) was to correct the itinerary, but they must not have done so. Despite the fact that they could see I called - they still wouldn't change my flight without the $200 change fee, since the operator apparently didn't annotate in the notes why I called, or change the flight correctly. Since all I have is a call log, and not a recording of the call, not sure how I would prove it.  I'm not upset they made a mistake fixing my mistake (I made a mistake too after all) - what upsets me is that they are so insistent on charging that $200 change fee - even after I can show them that the itinerary should've been fixed when I called them the first time!

american-airlines;2016-02-08;"Montevideo to London via Boston. Check-in MVD with no troubles, informed bag need to be collected with clearing custom in MIA. Boarding the flight 2A comes to my attention there is customer occupying the seat however due to aircraft change seat 2A was free. Due to that change other customer was yelling at me to change seat.  Later during flight when crew gave custom form I wasn't too advanced in Spanish so decided to go to front galley and ask cabin crew to provide me with English custom card - that was mistake as five crew members laugh at me saying ""you don't speak Spanish"". Diverted from MIA to TPA due to weather (sure this happened, I managed to have a little snooze being on the ground 4h-5h with not much information). Tried to change my flight over the phone to attend my meeting in BOS however no chance to arrange it. After long morning and early afternoon having already few changes on my ticket I was sent to MIA by the same flight and arrived over 10hrs late. Crew on TPA-MIA flight was very good and that was only great team I witnessed during five flights on my trip. No one was able to assist me with changes for next day and I was offered another change and fly MIA to LHR. Being so exhausted with so little informations and if there were any confusing so badly I accept the change. When I boarded B777 some customers were approaching cabin crew asking about aircraft change and no flat beds available - crew denied any changes. When I contacted customer service to find some explanations and gave feedback from my experience I couldn't be any more disappointed from response. ";NEGATIVE

Dismal customer service, rude counter workers and flight attendants, service boasted of wifi, television screens with 250 movies on the seat as well as USB chargers for the seats, none of which were available on a 5.5 hour flight. Boarding process was painful. Plane was dirty and some seats were worn out and had tears in them. Will not be flying with American Airlines again.

american-airlines;2016-02-07;"London to New York JFK, returning from Miami, and great flights with in Business Class on Boeing 777-300. The space, comfort, and privacy on this aircraft is second to none. The cabin crew were courteous and helpful (most of my flights with AA have been in coach where the rudeness of the staff used to be legendary). On both flights, the FA greeted by name, confirmed my meal order with me (requested on line) and took my coat. Outbound lunch was good, as were the wines. Drinks constantly replenished. A selection of snacks was laid out in the bar between meals, although I didn’t try them. The pre-landing snack was croque monsieur, which was ok but really no better than the pizza that you used to get in coach many years ago. Before landing, the purser walked through the cabin thanking each passenger for flying AA. A nice touch. Bose noise cancelling headphones are superb, although they collect them almost an hour before landing. On the return from MIA, the food and service were again very good. The steak on flights starting the in the US is always better than on those starting in the UK, and it was served on a very hot plate. The salad was excellent. FA asked if I wanted to be woken for breakfast. Although I didn’t I was awake when breakfast came round and it was surprisingly good. I’d previously flown Business Class on the US Airways A330. The 777-300 seat is similar but improved. There is no gap between the seat and the wall, where things can be lost on the A330. There is a vanity mirror in the storage cupboard. The TV screens are larger (15”). The seats have more adjustable positions. However, there is no storage under the footrest. A nice lightweight duvet and large fluffy pillow added to the comfort. The seats are a bit hard when sitting fully upright or fully flat for any length of time, but are very comfortable when reclined. Sleeping on the way back, the plane was very warm and I slept on top of the duvet which was very comfortable indeed. The washrooms on this plane are very nice, particularly the one on the starboard size which is double sized. The equipment makes this Boeing 777-300 the best business class across the Atlantic, and the service was up to par. The downside of this plane is that all the seats are very private, and if you are travelling with a companion then even in the middle pair you can’t really see or talk to each other. If you want to socialise with a travelling companion, you may not like this plane.  IFE was fair, not a lot of new films but enough newish and classics to keep me happy. I've marked down ground service because of a problem at LHR. I am gay and was travelling with my partner. The check in operative at tried to make us check in separately. When I asked if married couples had to check in separately she said no. I explained that my travelling companion was my Civil Partner, and that we had the same legal rights as a married couple. She was embarrassed and apologetic, but making assumptions about peoples sexuality is inappropriate. Business class check in and fast track security at LHR are excellent.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2016-02-06;"New York JFK to Miami was on a refurbished American Airlines Boeing 767 with international business class flat bed seating. The seating is not as good as on the 777-300, but it’s a big improvement on the angled seating on the 777-200, and for a short domestic flight it is exceptional. The 1-2-1 configuration means every seat is accessible from an aisle, and the centre pairs are good for couples travelling together. All seats are forward facing. Service was friendly and rather informal. The food was good – the steak was better than on the flight over from London. IFE is only provided when these planes are flying internationally, and is provided by Samsung tablets in business class. Having flown into JFK in International Business Class, we had access to the Admiral's Club Lounge. These lounges are poor compared to British Airways. We got vouchers for two premium drinks each, but you have to wait to be served by a lone overstaffed barman, and the choice of food is poor.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2016-02-06;"I hope it was the last time with American Airlines! I had to fly both ways to Philadelphia and back to Germany with American although on my flight list it said I would fly with Iberia and British Airways. Maybe I had really bad luck but on both flights there were mayor problems concerning delay. Before the first flight we were told, the aircraft is going to stop halfway to refuel so we would have a delay of several hours (they couldn't really tell us how much exactly). Having advised my transport ability from the airport to my final destination that I wouldn't arrive at time, we were told after a good half of the flight that we are going to fly directly to Philadelphia (as initially planned) because we had less wind than expected. The second flight was worse. The plane we were going to take arrived at Philly 20 min later than planned, so everything already was a bit delayed. After sitting in this machine over 1h without departing, we had to change plane(!) which lasted another hour, so we arrived at Amsterdam with over 2 hours of delay. While changing planes in Philadelphia I heard from several passengers that this is typical for AA, that they had come to Philly with a delayed AA flight and that they would never be able to get their train (just as me!) or connecting flight (except an American Airlines flight because that one you get because of its delay again - so if you fly AA, only fly AA). If there weren't all the other critical aspects in comparison to the flights' price. On other transatlantic flights of the same duration and price with Lufthansa or KLM, a personal screen with plenty of movies to chose is standard. Just as 2 ordinary meals plus snacks and comfortable seats with room for legs. On each of these 2 American Airlines flights, I had a disgusting meal and a tiny snack, there were small screens over every 5th row you can't see well from the mayority of seats (I had the luck of having one of these) and the seat couldn't be adjusted more than 2 inches backwards, so falling asleep wasn't possible for me, also because of permanent knee-seat-contact and the absolute impossibility of stretching my legs. It was horrible - in comparison with normal airlines such as Lufthansa or KLM.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2016-02-04;"My husband and I paid $311 extra for our seats to and from Honolulu for our dream vacation with American Airlines. These fees were so that we could sit together for the flights and for extra leg room. We never got the extra leg room on any of the 4 flights and had to argue with the counter people to even get to sit together. For example, when checking in with AA mobile app (which doesn't work well) for our flight from Honolulu to Phoenix, the app showed our assigned seats as being available for an extra fee (which we had already paid). We were then assigned standard seats (no leg room) and 6 rows apart. Finally, we got a counter agent to at least sit us together for the flight but we were told that this was a ""different plane so seats were different"". If this was even true, isn't it good business to take care of those that paid extra for better seats and then assign remaining standard fare seats? It appears that American charges at least double for this bait and switch. Who knows how many ""extra"" fees they charged for special seating and then assigned standard seats? We know for a fact that they did so on the HNL to PHX flight, as we spoke to the people occupying our originally assigned seats. The flight to Honolulu was so bad that my arm was cramped against the cabin wall resulting in numbness for most of the flight. As a result of not having room to stretch my legs for me, as a diabetic, resulted in my ankles swelling terribly on both 6 hour flights. American should be ashamed of their rude and unapologetic staff and charging fees for services that they do not deliver.";NEGATIVE

In-seat videos provided plenty of entertainment choices for the 4 hour flight. Gogo wifi was great - worked throughout the flight. Turbulence was very bad 30 minutes out of LAX due to El-Nino winds. Pilot kept us informed and did a good job. Landed smoothly and was a good flight. AA gets really bad reviews here - I fly them 150,000 miles a year and yes - I've had some bad flights.

After arriving in Arkansas, I went up to Delta to get my boarding pass and they had no record of me! The American Airlines employee failed to send my info or even inform me that I didn't actually have a seat for the connecting flight, but rather sent me there to just get me out of Fort Worth. I was literally stranded there -  there was 11 other people in the same situation. I had to rent a car and drive from Arkansas to Colorado.

american-airlines;2016-01-23;"Chicago to London Heathrow with American Airlines, and it was graceless from start to finish. No wait at check-in and through security in about 25 minutes. On a business class ticket you can access the Admirals Club lounge, which comes with a coupon for one free drink (including bottled water)!. Even then there's an expectation that you'll have to tip the barman who provides it. Otherwise, it's a few cheese crackers, cheese cubes and assorted nuts. There's a water fountain in the lounge, if you're really thirsty. Boarding was quick and stress free, and the refurbished Boeing 767-300 business class cabin offers a lof of personal space. There was a very long and unexplained wait after boarding until the doors were closed, and a further wait until pushback. You'd think that the flight attendants would be thinking ahead to how they'd be able to get on with service quicker on a night flight, such as taking dinner and drinks orders, but no, all standing around in the galley chatting. After take-off the flight attendants got out of their seats after 30 minutes. The next step was to manually log out 30 entertainment tablets and noise-cancelling earphones, so that was another 30 minutes gone. It was 90 minutes from take-off before the first drink hit the table. Dinner orders were then taken, and the meal service got under way. The cabin was kept at full illumination, with no attempt to create any form of night-time ambience. The starter was a mushroom carpaccio, which was very tasty, followed by what you'd think would a safe option 'steak in demi-glaze of blue-cheese'. The demi-glaze looked like oatmeal, and the steak was bloody in the middle, so after a few cuts, the blood started running everywhere, and it quickly became a pink, inedible mess. The dessert was ice-cream, which took a full 15 minutes before you could even crack off a chip with a spoon. The flight attendants were regularly doing the rounds throughout the flight, and nobody wanted for a drink. I passed on on the breakfast option of a quiche lorraine and spicy sausage, as this seemed like the perfect recipe for early-morning heartburn. The seat was extremely comfortable, but if you're looking for a business class product that delivers some style and atmosphere, this isn't it.";NEGATIVE

American airlines canceled two of our initial connecting flights we had booked, no problem we understand its business on their part. But when they rescheduled our flights for us the new flight times did not allow time between flights for customs, rechecking bags as we re-entered the country and changing terminals. When we called to get assistance changing these new flights (that AA had changed) their representatives were anything but accommodating! Rude as I explained that we could not make connecting flights as they had rescheduled, the supervisor told me I could say the sky was blue but it didn't change that they couldn't refund me for flights I wanted to cancel - and remember they are the ones who changed my flight scheduling flights without enough time to make connections. She just kept telling me no refund because it was me wanting a schedule change. When I asked her to help me cancel these flights altogether and start a new flight schedule she said no, that I needed to go online and do it myself, because our call had already taken 60 minutes.

We arrived at our accommodation to find that American Airlines credit card declined 4 times. We were then asked if we would go to a new hotel at 2:30am which required us to use a shuttle that left every 20 min to go back to the airport and then go on a 2nd 20min shuttle to go to the new hotel. It is currently 3:30am and they are yet to provide a credit card that has been accepted for a $115 payment. They also provided a $7 food voucher.

The guy making announcements was whispering so we all weren't quite sure which gate. When asking the lady at the gate for clarification she was barking at everyone and acting like we were bothering her. Waking up at 2:30am for a 5am flight with an eta of 7:30am is doable if it goes according to plan - this was painful.  Needless to say, I was not quite sure I was in capable hands after 2 hours of them fumbling around. We got to Dallas 2hrs later! Thankfully we did not have a connecting flight after.

american-airlines;2016-01-19;"American Airlines from London Heathrow to Chicago was one of the best business flights I've had for a long time.  Check-in and bag-drop took seconds and the lounge was quiet and fairly empty first thing in the day. I chose this flight as it was the newly-configured business cabin on the Boeing 767-300. Overall impression very good, seemed spacious and every seat is an aisle seat, which is a huge plus. I had a window seat, and it actually was a window seat - rather other airlines where you sit at an angle and have to twist to look out. The seat had a large fixed table area between the seat and the aisle, so there was no possibility of being knocked by someone on their way past. Like all new products there were a few design issues. You have to be more or less upright before you can release and then raise the table, but you get the hang of it eventually. The seat controls are very sensitive and you can often accidentally move your seat if you arm is laying where it normally would. The meal service was good, pre-ordered main course was there, and it seemed a very honest product. A very cheap appetiser, just humous, olives and pitta bread but then a delicious fish main course, with a choice of dessert and cheese. You had to wait for the entertainment system to be distributed after take-off, in the form of content loaded tablets and noise-reducing headphones. The 767's were always noisy old crates, but if you take along your own headphones and entertainment, there's no need to wait for theirs (although there is a huge choice of material). The seat was one of the most comfortable I've sat in for ages, it moved around easily, and in combination with a built in footstool, it wans't long before I had found the perfect position and was so comfortable I didn't want to get up. I'm tall, and couldn't reach the back of the footwell however hard I tried, so it felt like there was real space to stretch out. The afternoon snack was again straightforward, a charcuterie plate of meats, cheeses and breads plus cookies. Looked after well by the flight attendants throughout the flight.

The AA computer reports that it is in Miami and it will follow the next morning on the 9am flight, so we happily head to our hotel. We've never seen the bag since and it's now 3 weeks later. If we check on the computer, it says the bag has not been located and to check back later. If we call, we are told the same thing. I feel like no-one is looking for my bag and it's just a case of 'computer says no'. All they tell us is to fill out their outdated paper based property form and send off a claim with receipts for all items over a certain value (which we don't have for everything in the case). I feel like no-one cares that my bag with some prized possessions has gone missing and they will just pay out - I'm expecting less than the full amount the case is worth, due to not being able to provide receipts for things that were a gift / more than a couple of years old. This would definitely put me off travelling with them again.";NEGATIVE

When I asked the girl at the American Airlines desk she couldn't help me and said to ask in Dallas. I called customer service, they still had me listed in row 8, not in row 17 and 16 (my son and I weren't even together now), then my wallet app ticket updated so I called customer service again - they still had us in row 8. In Dallas we were stuck with rows 17 and 16, not the seats I paid for, and then found out how difficult it is to get a refund for something that is clearly their fault. We got to Boston at 12:37am and our 4 bags, two suitcases and two ski bags didn't make it. The woman at the counter was rude. I reviewed a call in the morning saying my two ski bags made it and would be delivered by 2pm (I should mention my son was going back to college the next day) but they didn't know where my other two bags were and I was told to call back in a bit. I call back and my two bags were still in Texas and they ""hoped"" they would be here on the 3 pm flight. I called the 800 number quite a few times trying to get a straight answer and was told different things each time. Finally around 5pm I was told my other two bags had made it to Boston. I called to see where my ski bags were as it was past 2 and no bags yet. I was told they didn't make it to Boston until 2 so how could they be promised to be here by then I was told. Finally the driver called and said he'd have my ski bags here by 11pm! I never heard about the delivery of my other two bags so I called once again, got told they would ""rush"" the delivery as 4 hours later they were still at the airport - finally I got an email saying the delivery has started. The ski bags arrived close to 11 and the other two bags about 10 min later. What a hellish experience. We had to waste my sons last day home for winter break waiting for suitcases that didn't come when we were told, and I made hours of phone calls and was given a run around.

He was sitting toward the front and I was over the wing area. We did not mention it to the flight attendant because she was so rude to begin with. I spoke with a number of other passengers and they all felt it was extremely hot. We were nauseous by the time our 2.75 hr flight was over. The temperature wasn't the part that upset me as much as the flight attendant's attitude. One of the other passengers asked for more ice and the flight attendant said ""I will in just a bit, like I told the other guy, I only have two hands"". Unnecessary rudeness.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2016-01-14;"My review is about the customer service rather than the flight itself. I recently booked an American Airlines flight from Austin to Oakland but found other more time-friendly flights. After cancelling the flight, I inquired about a refund. The representative told me the charge was $200 for rebooking - more than the original ticket cost. Obviously I was angry. After speaking with a manager at their Phoenix Reservation Service Center, my fee was waived. It was not of course without expressing my displeasure with the airline's policy. I decided to rebook the flight for the sake of convenience and cost - why use another airline if I could not receive a refund? Passengers would do well to be wary of nonrefundable tickets and hidden fees.";POSITIVE

american-airlines;2016-01-12;"The American Airlines flight from Detroit to San Antonio was not overly noteworthy. They handled the flight as expected with friendly staff, nice aircrafts, and pleasant flight times. However on the return trip, my girlfriend and myself were not impressed in the least. We arrived two hours early for our flight as expected and proceeded to wait for our plane. We weren't informed at any time that our aircraft was behind schedule, however it landed roughly twenty minutes past the time we were supposed to board. After the plane arrived we were informed that no carryon ""larger than a briefcase"" do all passangers needed to valet check their bags. This created an interesting issue when boarding as a pile of carryons began to block the path onto the plane. After boarding a plane that seemed to have been built in the seventies, we were informed that we were not going to be able to leave for 40 minutes due to weather in our connector in chicago. something that is to be expected this time of year. What wasn't expected was the condescending attitude of the entire staff. A fellow passanger stated that they needed to check the landing time, because he was going to a military funeral he would rather not miss. The flight attendant stated that they couldn't control the weather and walked away. After a hellish two and a half hour flight in an old, loud, cramped plane we arrived in Chicago for our layover. We than had to wait twenty minutes in the jetway while they unloaded each individual bag into the mass of passangers. noteworthy at this time is that Chicago was sitting at 6 degrees. We rush through the terminal to our connector flight and make it right as the plane is boarding. I give the employer at the gate my ticket and begin to walk to the airplane. He cleared his throat and stated my bags, that I had taken all of the way to Texas as a carryon, were to large for the flight. I inform him they are the same ones we went down to Texas with, but apparently that is not enough. Because he stated that I must place them into a size verifier to show that they are in fact acceptable. I preceeded to place them into the bracket, which showed them to clearly be the correct size. His response was to turn around and simply walk away, leaving me to puzzle over the correct next step. Overall, I felt belittled, and outright disrepected. I will not be taking another American Airlines flight due to this dreadful experience, even if it means higher costs or less ideal landing times.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2016-01-11;"I will pay a premium to fly with other airlines in the future. Our American Airlines departure from Miami was so stressful after a much needed vacation to decompress. We arrived 2-1/2 hours early and went to the AA terminal to check in. There were lines at every kiosk and hundreds of people waiting on line throughout. We got on line and waited 40 minutes at a kiosk (several were out of service it seems). Everyone who got a turn at bat eventually arrived a problem which required a customer service person to come over and help them. The help mainly consisted of sending them to the baggage check/kiosk service lines. Our turn was no different. As our baggage tags began to print, the machine had a glitch, indicating that it was probably out of tag stickers. We flagged down a customer rep who - you guessed it - sent us to the baggage check/kiosk service line where we waited another hour plus. Everyone we watched was having to remove stuff from their bags and this was very time consuming. When we got to the front of the line, they weighed our bag (which was the identical bag we had flown in with - nothing added!) and told us it was 2 lbs over and we could remove items or pay a $100 upcharge for the overweight bag. Since by now our flight was boarding and we still had not gone through security, we felt compelled to pay the charge. As we were boarding, our daughter with a smaller bag carry on was forced to check it anyway, as most of the other passengers were also being forced to check. (Why did we bother to stand in line for 2 hours if the flight attendants were tagging bags at boarding?) A woman on our flight told us how they were forced to layover in Miami overnight after waiting in the airport all day. They were not comped for their room. Several people on that flight missed connections for their vacations, and one couple missed their cruise. Does American know or care that people save all year to enjoy a vacation and then have to put up with this kind of crap?? We will fly any airline but AA going forward.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-01-10;"I am an AAdvantage member and American Airlines credit card holder and I was just hung up on by an American Airlines supervisor. I fly monthly to weekly for work with multiple airlines. I am flying with American Airlines tomorrow from Madison to Seattle via Chicago. After my travel agent booked my flight I went onto my mobile app to select my seat. All the open seats had an up charge to select them. So, I decided to wait to get a seat assignment at check in. This morning I checked in on my mobile app. I was assigned a seat and given my boarding pass like usual. A few hours later I got on to the seat selection portion of my app. It showed the seat I was in did not recline. It also showed that all the seats except one in the back still had an up charge. So, I picked the seat in the back of the plane. After confirming my seat change I saw that the seat I had been assigned originally was a preferred seat with extra leg room and priority boarding. It also showed that to move back to that seat I was initially assigned I would have to pay an up charge. I decided to call reservations to see if there was anything I could do to keep the same seat level I'd been assigned but switch to one that reclines. This is a 4 hour flight at 5am after all. The rep said she couldn't explain what happened and couldn't help me because I was already signed in. She did say that it shouldn't have happened (all seats shouldn't have up charges and I should've been able to move seats in the cabin I was assigned). So, I decided to call the mobile app technical support line to see if they could at least tell me what happened. The tech person sent me to a supervisor who was supposed to be able to help. The supervisor listened to me explain what happened then proceeded to accuse me of lying because it didn't line up with the activity on my account. She said I would've had to pay for my original seat assignment claiming I hadn't completed my transaction and had I gone to the ""last screen"" I would've been asked for a credit card. I explained that I didn't ever ask for an upgrade and that I merely checked in and did fully check in without ever being asked for a credit card or told I had priority seating. I also told her I had the preferred seat on my boarding pass. She said that had I kept that seat and gone to the airport tomorrow, I would've been told I had to pay $68 or switch to whatever seats were left open at the back of the plane. I told her that sound strange and didn't seem like great customer service. She then asked ""what are doing right now"". I explained I was just looking for an explanation of what happened (was it an issue with my app?) and looking for someone to make me feel like a valued customer. I really wanted to understand what went wrong, I fly too much to deal with this and have never had anything like this happen before. The woman then rather heatedly announced that they are the best airline in the world. I told her our conversation wasn't demonstrating that and that the reason we were talking right now was because I wanted to give them a chance to show me that. I asked if she could just help me understand what happened and confirm the issue wasn't there for the other leg of my flight. She then told me to have a nice day and hung up on me. I was shocked. I did not use curse words or insult her. I was not screaming though I was frustrated. It was shockingly bad customer service.";NEGATIVE

I have never ever been treated this way when I am just trying to get on to my flight.

Litter is cleared quickly and another beverage service. About 2 hours later a beverage service and ice cream. Approximately 90 minutes before landing, a beverage and second meal is served. The food is decent, didn't like the sandwich, however, would have much preferred the pizza they used to serve.

The first segment was OK and landed in time in a new Boieng 737-800. There was WiFi on board, although very very expensive. The problems started in Dallas, where after boarding, we had to wait in an old Boeing 777-200 for 1.5 hours, for the luggage to be unloaded and redistributed so that the weight of the aircraft to be ideal. After take-off, the IFE started to work, but you couldn't just play the movie you wanted, you could either jump in the middle of it, or wait about 15 minutes until it will start again. As it wasn't enough, this system went out of power doing the middle of the movie, the crew had no idea and after 30 minutes it came back to life. Of course, I had to watch a movie 3 times from the beginning as you couldn't fast forward or anything. The food was generally bad, as was the wine they gave us. Just a small blanket and a pillow, no other things for the night. The crew didn't give much of an interest. I guess the old entertainment system was just because it was a night flight (scheduled departure 22:10) and not many people use it. That is why I rate it as an average experience. I will try for the future not to fly them.";NEGATIVE

They seated us nowhere near each other although seats together were plainly visible on said console, when we mentioned this to the staff they told us we would be able to change this at the gate. No you can't. The stroppy little madam who appears half an hour before gate closure refused point blank to alter seating, despite families with young children being separated, unless you paid extra for seating. There was no attempt to seat people together in New York. The entertainment for the flight to Manchester was a tiny overhead screen you couldn't see in the centre aisle which weren't worth neck ache to see. Food and drinks were okay, thank goodness the flight was only 7 hours. Only two toilets. The internal flights between destinations in America were worse - we were only offered three drinks, one of which was water, no food despite the flight being 7 hours. American Airlines does not include food and drinks.

Seat back entertainment didn't work for me, USB chargers on both seats didn't work. Cabin crew weren't exactly professional, and down right silly on the PHL-YHZ leg (not aware that Halifax has a different time zone, no idea of scheduled arrival time, generally inarticulate). The aircraft from PHL-YHZ (operated by American Eagle) had an old plane smell, and the bleak interior of the ERJ 145 seemed to be yellowing with age.

This was quite a shock to us, we fly Alaska all the time, and never have this issue. Service onboard was not what you would expect in first class, seats on most flights were pretty uncomfortable, the food was ok, except for the flight from Charlotte to Miami, where ""lunch"" was a bag of chips (on a 2hrs + flight), on this flight we notice the flight attendant serve herself a 3 course meal. We had a lost bag on the inbound flight. The only decent service we received was on the flight between Miami and Pointe a Pitre, it was operated by American Eagle.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-01-04;"On December 27th, my husband and I had tickets to fly out of Newark airport into Charlotte, then San Juan PR. When we arrived at the airport there was confusion amongst everyone. We waited for what seemed to be over 2 hours to see an agent. The agents left the economy class to serve priority customers. All three agents served priority. No one was at the counter for economy class. Several customers and I tried to speak with the supervisor, but she refused to speak to us. One gentleman was nice enough to take care of us. We found out that our flight was cancelled. My husband and I had to return home, which cost us $55.00, then catch the next available flight the next evening leaving JFK. This cost us another 65.00. We arrived San Juan at 2am on the 29th. We lost 1 full day, plus one night of our vacation time. On Jan 2, we were assigned to return home. We had two carry on bags because we were not planning on taking the connecting flight. When we were on line to aboard the plane, the young girl said, you will have to check your bags, with no explanation. I said, we can't because we are not taking the connecting flight. She never looked at me. She just repeated, ""you Have to check your bags, you will get them at the gate on the other side!"" When we went onboard there were many empty bins. I asked the steward, why did the young girl at the gate make us check our bags if there are several empty bins. He apologized and said, she should have checked with us first. I have to say I didn't feel safe or supported with most of the staff working for American Airlines. My husband and I felt we were treated very poorly. We've been traveling regularly. We used other carriers and never experienced such unprofessional behavior. ";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2016-01-03;"My family and I flew from Milwaukee (MKE) to San Jose Del Cabo (SJD) with a connection in Phoenix (PHX). The Milwaukee flight was about 4 hours long and only a beverage service was done. The aircraft was an old US Airways plane and seat were not very comfortable. At Phoenix we had a short layover, about 1 hour 30 minutes and the flight was stopped during taxi because our gate was occupied. We got to the gate abut 30 minutes later and we basically sprinted towards our connection. The connection was done on an A321, still old interior, new livery. This flight was a little more comfortable but no beverages because of turbulence. The return flight was all on time and every thing about the same. I really hope American Airlines will improve its domestic service with free snacks on flights more the 3 hours long. Also same rule should apply to alcoholic beverages. They should improve seats, especially in economy, with IFE and make it free on longer domestic flights. My experience was not one I would love to do again, unless American improves. Hope they work hard and build something better. The one positive part was the price which was exceptional with the times and connections.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2016-01-03;"Partial review on behalf of my daughter and friend. They bought an American Airlines ticket from London Heathrow to St Thomas via Miami. They should have had two hours from touchdown in Miami to catch the connection to St Thomas. The flight from Heathrow arrived 50 minutes late. None of the American Airlines staff made any attempt to assist these two girls in making the connection. They sold them the ticket, so they must have known that they had a connecting flight, yet every enquiry they made they were told to wait. They missed the connection and eventually someone at AA did at least organise them a hotel. As I type 08.20 (US eastern) on the 3rd, they are in the departure lounge in Miami hoping for a cancellation on the midday flight to St Thomas. If they miss this, then they will not make their dream holiday, flotilla sailing holiday around the British Virgin Islands. The handling of this matter by American Airlines staff has so far been dreadful. Let's hope they pull out the stops to put right the problems caused by the late arrival of their aircraft and subsequent poor handling of customers needing to make connecting flights by their airport based staff";NEGATIVE

We were directed off the aircraft and given no information for an hour as we waited. Once back on, the plane arrived 3.5 hour later than originally planned. Traveling back to Chicago, the flight was delayed for an hour. Managed to make up some time in the air, until we were taxiing into our gate and the plane braked suddenly because we hit a truck. We sat on the runway as the police and fire departments inspected the scene. As we were sitting there, I was asked to move seats by the flight attendant so he could have my seat to take pictures of the accident.

Had to go to Harrisburg instead of Allentown! Had to cancel reserved rental car. Arrived in Harrisburg at about 2:30 am. Agent referred us to a taxi - there were no taxis! Luckily some guy in a van called a taxi service for us. Very grumpy driver finally arrived 20 mins later. Had to spend night in a hotel.

Instead we had to fly LGA to CLT leaving NYC, and CLT to EWR returning to NYC. Yes, they had a jacked up the price by $200/ticket just to fly round-trip. If this was first class with an airline that was dependable, maybe I'd pay the price, but not when I know it's already going to be bad. I was right, it was bad. We stood online coming home from CLT, scanning our boarding passes. Some passengers sat down on the plane, we were just about to step onto the plane. Before we get one foot on, we are told there is a 1.5 hour delay. We now have to all exit the plane, un-scan our boarding passes. 40 minutes later we have to board again. Passengers were late assuming they had 1.5 hours to eat. We should have boarded the plane from the start since it took 45 minutes just to get all the passengers seated and carry-on's handled. We could've saved some time then.  I stopped flying with AA since I had options, now they merged with US Airways and I'm out of luck.

We arrived an hour earlier to turn in our luggage and receive our boarding passes but when we got to TSA we realized the guy gave us the wrong boarding passes which belonged to someone else who was going to the Dominican Republic. We went back to the man who seemed like he had no idea what he was doing because he kept asking the other person next to him for help. Once everything was taken care of we headed back to TSA and went through the process. By the time we arrived at the gate we were not allowed to enter because we were late. The lady at the desk refused to help us board another flight, instead she went to text on her phone. Another lady helped get on a flight with TACA airlines. Things got worse after that. We had to go on separate flights to Miami. I arrived at 9 pm and my mother with my 2 younger sisters arrived at 10 pm. Next we went to board our flight with TACA airlines. We had to walk across the entire airport to find TACA. Then had to wait until 3:52 am for our plane to arrive. We finally got on the plane but later we found out they were going to stop at Nicaragua for a while and from there we would arrive to San Salvador. In Boston we were told our luggage would arrive to San Salvador before we did. TACA told us the same in Miami but when we arrived to San Salvador our luggage was nowhere to be found. We received our luggage almost a week later but my bag did not arrive. I was forced to buy clothes in El Salvador because I never received my bag. I came back on Tuesday Dec. 29 2015.

american-airlines;2015-12-29;"Our trip was originally scheduled for San Francisco to Dallas Fort-Worth (Flight #2417), and Dallas Fort-Worth to Piedmont (#5812) in North Carolina. Flight from SFO to DFW departed and landed with no complications. Original leave time for flight #5812 on Sunday was to depart at approximately 8:30, to land in GSO at 11:05. Our troubles began when the gate changed from B47 to B1 with no notice or confirmation. The only reason we found out was from a non-airport flight tracker web site. Waiting at B1 with the rest of the people scheduled to take the flight, our gate was then changed again, back to B47 with no confirmation or notification from the airport. At this time the gate personnel at B1 still had no idea. The only reason we found out, again was from a non-affiliate web site. After running to the gate at the other end of the airport with 5 minutes to spare, (this because the Sky Link was broken) we made it to B47. At B47 there was no Gate attendant, only a message on the screen informing us that the flight would depart at the scheduled time. As we watched the scheduled time come and go, again with no gate attendant in sight the screen changed again with a later departure time, still no gate attendant at this time. After 2 hours a non-related flight attendant traveling with our group answered the ringing phone, to inform the control center that there was no gate attendant, no pilot, no crew, and that the plane had been sitting there since when we first arrived. About 5 minutes later the supervisor showed up. She was unresponsive to anyone’s questions, and refused to talk to anyone. She got on the phone a few times, typed in the computer and we watched the departure time change again. Only this time is was changed to 11:00, which was the same time as another scheduled flight. These people were also now at the gate and as confused as we were (because the airport flight screens said both our flights would be leaving at the same time, from the same gate). We finally got word that we were waiting on a crew, and we watched a pilot and two stewardesses board the plane. Again, no notice from any gate personnel. After we watched the now changed 11:30 departure time come and go, we watched the pilot and two stewardesses deboard the plane. Still no one at our gate to answer any questions, as the supervisor had left hours before. We asked the pilot and stewardesses what was happening and they responded that they had been sitting on the plane for too long, and were now over their hours. They also informed us once they walked away there was no one to fill their spots, and the flight would inevitably be cancelled. Again no notice from the screen that still said it was departing at 11:30, which at this time it was 12:30. I called, and they rebooked us to fly out Monday, from Dallas to Ft. Meyers, to Charlotte, then Greensboro. The woman on the phone then told me that she could not give vouchers for hotels over the phone. to go back to the attendant we first spoke with. American Airlines will never get our business. I refuse to pay thousands of dollars, and be made to feel the way we were treated.

american-airlines;2015-12-29;"Flew Chicago to Miami with my girlfriend on Dec 2nd then on to Milano a few days later: the international flight was an Iberia ticket operated by AA which I explicitly selected as I wanted a direct flight to Milano on the way back. I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals.";POSITIVE

Customer service is almost non existent, the $200 change fee is uncalled for especially for frequent fliers. The problem is I don't think that they are trying, also I have been very keen on the price increases (sometimes close to 70% increase) brought about by the merger where now American is the only carrier to certain routes. For some reason in my experience one out of every 30 flights gets cancelled (or just my luck) for a non distinct reason, I don't want to accuse but usually I can intuitionally predict when this will happen, that is when I see that its substantially empty a week before the flight. Delays are ever more frequent, in the last three flights we had a 30 minute delay because they were still loading bags, three other delays for flight attendants not in or pilots not in yet. No snacks, and the food for purchase which is not much is usually not even available as they stock very little of it and the tempting items are taken quickly. The advantage program keeps getting changed not for the better. If the prices were cheap I would not complain as much. The few planes that have the new IFE system carry vey little media and no free tv, also the gogo in flight is really too expensive for the average passenger, if it was a reasonable rate I would use it for other than the occasional free partial pass.  Bottom line American used to be just ok, now its just subpar and expensive.";NEGATIVE

This second flight was also cancelled last minute, and we were told that we would either be able to put on a standby for a flight 4 hours later flight or get booked for a flight two days later, the latter was clearly not an option. To my disbelief, about an hour and a half later flights began leaving for Dallas without our knowledge, it was not announced on the PA system. Eventually, we got on a flight at 10pm, but it doesn't end there, our flight to Calgary was already cancelled. The next flight from Dallas to Calgary was supposed to depart at 10.50am the next day. We did not board until 11.45am, and as the plane was getting ready to depart, one of the engines failed, resulting in the plane going out of service, and the cancellation of the flight.

What did matter was that after contacting American Airlines about our problems, they did not even respond until the 3rd letter and then told us that it is not their policy to give any compensation for lost luggage unless we had purchased approved items and had saved all receipts.

This morning, I checked their website again and again. It is not easily followed. The credit card and the frequent flyer program use the same name. If you get the credit card, you are exempted the baggage fee. If you fly 20,000 miles in their program, you are exempted the baggage fee. It took plenty of clicks to piece this together.

She was unapologetic and very rude. This airport predominately serves the Army community and it is sad that we are subjected to such treatment. Many of us are not afforded the opportunity to go on leave frequently or for lengthy amounts of time, so these delays are crucial. I think the service rendered by American Airlines is disheartening.

It seems that their presence is strictly contained at maintaining the cabin within permissible safety standards, all other tasks being sidelined.

We boarded the plane to find a substandard first class cabin. Carry-on bags barely fit into the overhead compartments. There was no lie-flat seating. There wasn't even a pillow! Seriously, on an overnight flight - no pillow in first class? Then we found out there was no food either! American cuts off food service at 10:00 pm, which is ridiculous. We'd just flown overnight with Hawaiian Air the previous night, and they served a full dinner after take-off at 1:30am. Yet American didn't even offer the traditional snack basket. We were doled out a handful of warm nuts, and a cookie. Plan on starving with American. Speaking of no bed and no food, the third ""no"" we encountered was no entertainment. During a 5-hour flight, they didn't even offer tablets. We were totally on our own. The flight attendant did inform us that, if we happened to bring our own tablet, we could purchase movies during the flight. I kid you not - in first class they want you to buy your own entertainment. Then the dingbat flight attendant failed to turn on the cabin lights for the first half hour of the flight, so we couldn't even read our own books. We sat in total darkness twiddling our thumbs. Summing up American Airlines first class cabin on a 5-hour overnight flight, there is: No lie-flat seat No pillow, No food, No snacks, No entertainment, Extended darkness. Apparently American thinks passengers should sleep on an overnight flight, since they provide barely more than a floor for us to ride on.

My last trip was delay 2 hours at take off and they told me to check on connecting flights at the next destination. They would not even tell me before takeoff if they could book me to my destination.

I paid for upgraded seats and was assigned center aisles or back of plane next to the washroom. On the return flight that was supposed to arrive at 8PM it arrived at past midnight. One of the reasons we were so late was I heard an attendant at the desk complaining they diverted our flight crew and pilot to another flight. The last several times my wife has flown the flights have been several hours late arriving at midnight instead of 9PM. As of Today 12/23 my daughter flying in from Boston with 1 layover is now delayed 3 hours+ and the plane she was supposed to catch at 5:30 just took off 3 hours late for the stopover in Huntsville Alabama before returning to CLT to become her ride that at Best is going to be getting her in 4 hours late. AA has made travel in and out of Augusta and Columbia areas a total nightmare.";NEGATIVE

Ground staff gave me a real hard time because my name was too long and on the boarding pass etc. They told me some weird things (travel agent language) and they stopped me travelling. I had to go through so many people and hassle to keep moving. Honestly, we pay and buy the ticket and we do not enter any date on the system. If I buy the ticket from AA then it is their issue.

Decided that I wanted to get a earlier start in the day and wanted to change my flight. There is a lack of infomation on the site so I decided to call their customer service. They were backed up on calls so I put in my number in the automated system for me to hold my place in line and not have to stay on the phone. 20 mins later I get the call the machine said that its transfering me with a lost connection! I called again put myself on the list agian to speak with someone. 20 mins later someone calls to tell me that if i wanted to change my flight to earlier in the day that it will cost me $200! The earlier flight ticket is only $136! The woman told me that I would need to cancel my flight and eat $108 and buy the new ticket for $136. I am never giving you any more of my money so I will deal with the later flight. Never again American Airlines.;NEGATIVE

The staff at Heathrow and on the flight were helpful, seats in economy were comfortable enough (would pay for main cabin extra next time just for the leg room), and the food satisfactory for a picky vegetarian like myself. The same goes for my domestic flight to ABQ, where everything was smooth and pleasant. I had some issues on my return flight, but the staff couldn't have been better. My flight from ABQ to DFW was delayed by 2 hours, which meant I had 10 minutes to make my flight to LHR on arriving at DFW. American Airlines staff at ABQ bumped me to main cabin extra so I could be one of the first off of my domestic flight, and put me on reserve for a later to flight to LHR if I missed my designated flight. Of course, they were sceptical about my luggage making the same flight given the allotted window, but talked me through the procedure for delayed luggage.  I actually made my flight on time, and miraculously my luggage was waiting for me at LHR when I arrived. A great trip with excellent service.";POSITIVE

We had to get really upset to get same day flight and traveling all around USA with our 2 kids. The worst part our baggages never came until - today is day number 3 of wearing same clothes.

american-airlines;2015-12-21;"Whilst I appreciate that the vast majority of reviews are referring to domestic flights within the US, and differing factors apply, I really cannot understand the wave of negativity re AA services. From the off, these were two excellent flights, on time in both directions, easy boarding, comfortable seats, perfectly adequate food and drink for the economy cabin, and helpful, friendly staff. I like the 2-5-2 layout of this type of 777, and I see the change to 3-3-3 as a retrograde step. A large number of people travel in pairs, and it's nice to be able to sit together without having to share a row of seats. It's for that reason that, when flying economy, I try, wherever possible to choose a route served by Airbus 330 or 340. The American Airlines economy seats are wide and comfortable. The IFE is very US biased, but, of course this is an American airline. Last time I flew AA, I felt the $5 charge for drinks was ridiculous, and I'm pleased to see that they have seen the error of their ways and reverted to generous free supply of beer and wine as well as soft drinks. I'd have no hesitation using this very convenient route from N Spain to Florida (BCN to MIA) again in the future.";POSITIVE

When asked about flights I was told I had to wait until 2:45 pm today to get on a flight that is 12 hours past the time I was supposed to arrive in New York. I arrived in Phoenix from El Paso at 8 PM yesterday. It's 10 am and I've been here since I got here. They refused any hotel services and any food vouchers, my luggage is probably lost by now. I have been flying on my own for 3 years now and have never ever had a problem like this. When I asked for a Lounge they laughed at me and told me to go sleep in the lobby.

At check in, we provided all of our necessary info and errors popped up with our flight. At first we thought it was due to our passports but the airline supervisor insisted it was their system. They just couldn't find us in the system even though we had our itinerary. She couldn't provide us a clear answer as to why we had errors in our flight. It didn't make sense since we were traveling with 4 other people going to the same destination and they went through check in just fine. We stood in line with the check in agent on the phone for 2 hours! Apparently she had to call every connecting flight we were taking. All the while she barely updated us on what was going on making us ask her for updates. All we received were $100 vouchers each for American Airline tickets that had to be used within the year. We had missed our flight and they had to rebook us for the following day. Note, our original tickets were purchased online and we paid extra money to be seated together. The rebooked tickets did not have any of our seats together! We asked the agent at the gate to please sit us together and she refused. She couldn't even try to move people around? We've taken other airlines where they happily moved people around so we could sit together and succeeded. I will never take American Airlines again!

The flight was 3/4 full, so I went to the two empty seats at the back and rested all the way to LA, the seats were comfortable, and the plane seemed new though some seats were worn and torn.

Couldn't even manage to sit with the person I purchased a ticket with. Now you must also pay for food. And on and on all these hidden fees. And if you cancel your flight it's $200.

Flying from or into Punta Cana, this means that we had many hours without food and with very little to drink as one is not allowed to pack anything to bring through TSA. To compound that when the Manchester flight was canceled due to fog we were left with no time to get any food either. The saving grace was that the flight attendants largely are very kind (save a few). I felt the booking procedure was deceptive as I did not know there would be additional charge for better seats when I purchased tickets. I will attempt to avoid this airline in the future.";NEGATIVE

I felt that although the flight from MAN to TPA via PHL was well priced, it had a rather a low-cost feel to it. Food was very poor as expected. There were very few drink runs and the crew as usual on American were all quite a bit older. However the A330 was in good condition, the seats were comfortable and the IFE worked. Internal flights both ways were 100% capacity but again were on time. I would definately use AA on this route as PHL was particularly impressive as a US entry point.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-12-10;"As a college student that was studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and it being time to go home I was nervous that something would happen on my American Airlines return journey as I was faced with a 14 hour delay on my way there. We board the plane in Buenos Aires and was delayed because of an ill passenger who turned out was drunk. And I was getting nervous because I had to go through passport control and customs and catch my connecting flight in Miami. After getting through customs in Miami I was told that I missed my connecting flight. The only way I could make it to my final destination that wasn't in the middle of the night was to take a train to the Ft. Lauderdale airport and catch a flight to Charlotte, N.C. that would connect me to Columbus, Ohio. I went to Ft. Lauderdale and got to the counter to check in my luggage and stood at the counter for 10 minutes and the people working there just ignored me by talking among themselves or playing on their computers causing me to miss the flight to Charlotte. Finally when someone paid attention to me they were very unapologetic and I demanded either a refund or to be put on a flight that connected with Columbus ASAP. They got me on a flight to Philadelphia that connected to Columbus and thankfully I those flights ran smoothly and on time. I sent an email to AA's customer service explaining to them why I will never be using American Airlines again. I will look into a different airline for international travel and use Southwest for domestic travel. The way they treat the people who pay money to fly on their planes is atrocious and I am surprised that they are still in business. Nobody deserves to be treated like how they treated me for something that was completely their fault.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-12-10;"I have accepted the fact that ""legacy"" carriers in the United States are nothing more than low frills, low service, nickle and diming, budget airlines without the budget price. At least American is. Fortunately for me, and the only reason I made this trip was the fare was extremely low. American Airlines charges for everything. Want to sit in the middle of the plane, thats extra. Want to watch anything on the brand new IFE devices, thats extra. Checking bags? Extra. Needless to say on this flight, the first leg was on a nearly new A321. If it was in service much more than a month I would be surprised. The flight left on time and arrived into LAX a few minutes early. One thing I can say, and I do not know if it was because the plane was new, or this particular model is outstanding, but the cabin pressurization was amazing. I had no effects at all from the flight to my normally very sensitive ears. On the return, the flight also left on time and arrived into Miami a few minutes early. I had no issues that needed dealing with, and the flight crew were all friendly. My issue with American is the fact that everything is extra. Fuel prices are at a record low, airline profits are at record highs, yet none of that has been invested into the flying experience in the form of reduced fees, or increased amenities.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-12-10;"I was returning home from Phoenix to Long Beach this morning (8.45am flight) with American Airlines. I had priority boarding, and as I approached the flight attendant at the door, he said I would have to check my luggage because it wouldn’t fit in the overhead bin. I’m sure I had a puzzled look and was shaking my head with confusion because I was able to fit it on my previous fit in the same plane configuration. I didn’t argue with him or say a thing, but it didn’t seem right. I get to my seat, I paid an additional $25 for the extra room on an Exit aisle, and there’s a bag under the seat in front of me (where my carry-on should go). I thought maybe a previous passenger had mistakenly left it behind. So I waited until most everyone had taken their seat, and hit the Attendant light. I could see the attendant (the same one that made me check my bag) look from the front cabin to see where the light was on, and when he saw it was above me, he just rolled his eyes. Then, a couple of minutes, from behind me I hear a gruff and bothered female voice. “Do you need something?” I explained that there was a bag in front of me and that I was concerned that someone had left it by mistake. She said in the same, bothered and unfriendly voice, “That’s a crew member’s bag. Just leave it, it’s fine where it is.” During the entire time pre-flight and flight, I never saw her smile or say a pleasant thing to anyone in the main cabin. Instead of asking, “Would you like some orange juice or some coffee?”, it was “What do you want?” It’s as if we were bothering her and why did we have to be on her plane? Finally, as I was walking off the plane, the front cabin attendant was wishing those in front of me a good day, but when I walked up, he just looked at me with a dead expression. He didn’t acknowledge me at all. It’s been a while since I’ve flown AA, and I don’t remember having an unpleasant experience before. Based on this experience, from both crew members, I will avoid AA for any future flights. AA needs to do some people skills training, as there are other choices for travelers. PS – the attendants on my outbound flight were pleasant and helpful. This review is for the return flight only – but it’s left a much bigger, and negative impression on me.";NEGATIVE

This was a 90th birthday surprise party for her. When she arrived at the gate escorted by my niece, she was informed that she could not carry on her luggage. This was because no American Airlines employee would be willing to lift her carry on case to the overhead bin. Her carry on case was within the size required for carry on, however, would not fit under the seat. My 90 year old mother is unable to lift items above her head. My niece was not permitted to enter the cabin of the aircraft to lift the carry on for her. My mother takes a variety on medications and could not risk the chance of losing her luggage in the stowed compartment of the aircraft. After extreme anxiety, my niece was able to purchase a $100 piece of luggage that would fit under the seat and would hold all of her things. Her case was not heavy or even filled. I contacted American Airlines customer service. After a month, American Airlines gave her a $50 flight coupon for her inconvenience. What a joke! My Mother was so shook up and was unable to enjoy her travel and her stay with us. Elderly people cannot deal with this type of issue.

Several of us on the flight were attempting to connect to London, and the later flight was filling up fast. Luckily I was near the front of the line. And then the gate agent upped and disappeared on us. Just walked away without saying anything to the person at the front of the queue. We thought we'd gone to the restroom or something and would be back. No - gone. The other agent didn't appear to notice or care when we pointed out this ridiculous behavior. After queuing back up at the end of the other line and finally getting some service, the later flight was full, of course. Delayed our vacation by a day and a half. No compensation. The flights themselves were OK, once we were actually on some flights. But I'll pay more to avoid American in the future. Too many awful customer service experiences with them.";NEGATIVE

We all got off plane and were specifically told our flight was cancelled and to see the rebooting station for a hotel voucher and food voucher. The food and hotel voucher was a no go as they ""delayed"" our flight and forced us all to stay in the airport with not a thing but a rocking chair and airport seats. The airport completely shut down leaving 200+ individuals stranded with no food/drink etc. Never was an attempt to let anyone know what was going on or our next step.

We went down the hall to the Southwest counter and were able to get on the Southwest flights at our own considerable expense (a great flight experience). Our return trip via American Airlines was also cancelled, but the San Juan agent was able to re-book on United. We have now been attempting for over a month, to get a refund for our cancelled outbound trip with no success.

Once I arrived in DC we were told the plane would be delayed 2 hours (originally supposed to leave at 10:10pm) to 12:01am due to maintenance problems with our plane coming from Portland, ME. Once the plane arrived at 11:45 they rushed us all onboard and then sat there for 40 minutes on the tarmac. Finally the captain came on and said due to more ""maintenance issues"" (but never specified) that they were ""trying to decide"" what to do - either switch us to a whole other plane or call to repair it. After about another 40 minutes of sitting a few of us starting to receive emails that the flight had been canceled all together. It is sad how Orbitz sent me an email quicker than they could tell me! After a 2 hour delay and 1.5 hours on the plane they finally canceled. But it gets better! With 70 of us and 1 woman at the service desk (who was very nice and trying her best!) we were told the only options were to wait until 11pm the next day (almost a full 24 hours) for a direct flight or take a flight to Chicago and have a 6 hour layover until Hartford. Due to myself being a clinician I could not afford to miss that much time, so I ended up taking a flight to White Plains, NY and drove myself to Hartford with a rented car! I wouldn't say I'm a frequent flyer, but I do fly a few times a year, and coincidently this was my first time flying American and also my worst experience ever! The flight crew had a ""don't care"" attitude and were not accommodating at all. The gentlemen next to me, after being on the plane for an hour, asked for some water to which she replied ""I'll have to ask the captain, but I can't be getting everyone beverages"" - surprise he never got the water, and when the captain came on the first time he said ""Sorry everyone for the slight delay in getting you out."" 3 hours isn't a slight delay! I can understand trying to be humorous but at 1 in the morning when we all have lives to get back to it came off as just crude! I get that everyone, especially the crew, is tired.

I went to buy tickets online and I thought twice about flying with American Airlines because every time I've flown them the experience has been dreadful. Flight delays, cancellations, horrible customer service. Besides my good judgement, I purchased 5 tickets with them. Almost immediately I realized I had made the purchase in error and called to get a refund, which I'm entitled to. I was put on hold forever, disconnected multiple times and told there would be no refund. They must be desperate for money if they have to act contrary to other airlines. ";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-11-28;"I have never had such a bad experience on a plane in my life. I was coming back to Atlanta from the Bahamas with American Airlines but I had a connecting flight through Miami. Getting onto the plane they made me check my carry-on because they had reached capacity (even though I was in the second group). I was hesitant doing so but I did as they asked. When we landed I waited for an hour and half in baggage claim before they told me where it was. They had left the bag in Miami because the plane was too heavy and couldn't carry anymore bags. (They didn't even tell me they were doing this.) The worst part was that I was going to the Auburn Alabama game in the morning and my ticket was in that bag so I had to miss the game. Also the rest of my family's bags were scuffed, one of the bags had the zipper ripped off and the pocket in the front ripped off as well. They asked if American Airlines would fix it or replace it and they refused to do either. The fact that I am actually taking the time to write this review is how angry I am. I will never fly this airline again. ";NEGATIVE

When they mess up too bad the customer pays and they say they are not responsible for any additional costs incurred. Their plane had problems which delayed our take off for four hours. The terminal staff were rude and arrogant. Their problems caused us to miss our connecting flight and our hotel transfer. We had to pay to regain both and they are not willing to reimburse because it is not there problem.

Not to mention that it stopped raining about an hour later. Today my flight got delayed for an hour because of a ""maintenance issue"".

The contempt that AA obviously has for its customers was quite an eye opener with not one ounce of customer service or care given at all, many of the passengers were Americans trying to get home to family for Thanksgiving. Whilst we all understand mechanical issues have to be dealt with and safety being paramount, you also need to have some level of empathy and a duty of care for your customers and there was a way AA could have dealt with a cancelled flight but they failed big time. Also listening to staff whispering and  discussing ongoing maintenance issues with this aircraft does not instill confidence. I will not give this airline another chance. Never again.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2015-11-25;"My trip started off a little rocky. Understandably, my flight was originally delayed two hours due to a passenger being sick. From there, bad weather caused my flight to be detoured and grounded in Kansas for 1+ hours before resuming the flight to Texas. During this entire flight time, we were only served drinks once (at the very beginning of the flight), and the flight was short on food due to the previous delay due to sickness. Therefore us passengers went 7+ hours with only one beverage service, and no available food. When we landed, we were all scrambling to reach our connecting delayed flights, if they hadn't been cancelled at that point yet. Luckily, I reached my gate in time, waited an hour, before realizing people were slowly disappearing even though there had been no announcement stating my flight had been cancelled (this was at 12AM). After inquiring if my flight was in fact cancelled, I was also told that every single flight to my destination was booked the next day with no openings on any flights for over a day. Desperate, I asked how I could get closer to my destination. I was put on standby for a 1:30AM flight out, and told I could take a 2 hour bus ride to my destination in the morning. Once again, upon landing at 2:30 in the morning, we were left unable to unload for one hour because flights were backed up. I get that weather happens, but the customer service to this point was terrible, and we never once receiving anything to drink. Once when I landed, I figured I should find out where my bus would be leaving from before finding a spot on the floor to close my eyes for a few hours. I was told by an airport worker I was in the right location, so I stopped my search and found my place on the floor. Waking up an hour and fifteen minutes early, just to be sure I wasn't given the wrong information, I began questioning where this bus would exactly turn up. After talking to 5 different people and being told 5 different places I should go to catch my bus, an American Airlines employee sent me all the way across the airport to a place where my bus was not taking off from, and no one could answer any of my questions. So, I returned to American Airlines, and finally my patience was spent. I explained my story, showed them my tickets, and the employee replied that in the ten years that they had worked there, they had never seen this bus ticket option before. Then after spending ten minutes making phone calls, they realized this bus service had in fact been around for 2 years. Never once did I receive an apology for being sent all around the airport, when this could've been solved by admitting they were unsure where this bus left from and making a phone call to find out the answer. I then had a 4 hour layover at the airport, before finally boarding a bus to my final destination. Arriving 17 hours later than I should have. I understand that we can't control the weather, and things happen. My issue with this experience was the awful customer service. I would have difficultly recommending flying with American Airlines due to my experience.";NEGATIVE

However, the way I was treated in Philly was inexcusable and the compensation was worse! First after missing my connecting flight I was told to go to Customer Service, which was a very long walk. Then there was a line with over 100 people in it, so I had to stand in line for well over 90 minutes, late at night. By 11pm, I was given a ticket for the next morning flight, no apology and no hotel. I was supposed to sleep in the airport. They would not even help me find a hotel, they gave me a phone number, in which I had to walk to a second customer service desk to use their phone and they couldn't even tell me a hotel close by to use. I called the phone number for hotels, but the quota for airline hotels was booked up by this time and I was left on my own to find a hotel, book it and pay for it. I have a disability, and I asked for a cart to help me through the airport, I was denied. The ticket girl, told me it wasn't that far to walk. Yes, it was! I ended up googling hotel, found one close by and got my own transportation to it. Caught my flight the next morning. When I called Customer Service and complained they reimbursed me less than half the cost of my hotel and gave me reward points that are useless. ";NEGATIVE

The security took over an hour as well and I arrived 10 minutes before departure but they had closed the gate! The attendant was very rude and said my only option was to stay the night or leave on a later flight 13 hours later and travel all night, she did not seem to care at all that I had an infant. A different individual ""magically"" found me a flight 2 hours later and she seemed annoyed. I ended up having an 11 hour overlay with an infant when I was originally supposed to have a 2.5 hour overlay and paid $400 extra. They weren't supposed to check my bag, it was supposed to be Gate check with my stroller and carseat, but they ended up checking it at my first flight so I was without baby cloths, diapers, and formula.

After a long 4 hour delay, the airline decided to give up on any further attempts of getting us to our desired destinations.  The error that occurred was not because of the weather, but ill-preparation from the flight crew. We were not accommodated in any way after the delay and cancellation, causing a loss of money. Our purchase or game tickets, hotel stays, rental cars, and even keeping our dog in a kennel at home became a huge waste of money, and all we got from the company was a simple, ""sorry.""

american-airlines;2015-11-20;"Having flown all over the country and flown all over the world, I have a bit of an idea of what a quality flying experience is, as well as what a bad experience is. My wife and our two toddlers had to get a flight out of San Diego to Salt Lake City via Los Angeles. She got to the airport with plenty of time, but being a Friday evening, the airport was packed. She went to check in at the kiosk, but it denied her and she had to wait in a long line to see a rep. Finally, she got to the front of the line, only to be told that she needed to go wait in another line because the counter she waited for was being closed. With two toddlers, who, thank the lord, were very well-behaved, a carry-on suitcase, and a stroller, she had to get into another line to wait all over again. By this time, her departure was getting close and she had not even gotten her ticket due to the kiosk denying her (for whatever reason) and being sent to wait again in another line. When she finally got to the ticket counter (again) the female rep told my wife that it was a waste of time to print her ticket as my wife and kids would surely miss the flight. There was still time to make the flight, but the time was running out quickly. Having no sense of courtesy, the rep began to close down her counter and handed out cards with a phone number that people would have to call to have their tickets printed. I have never seen or heard of that before. After more time was wasted at the counter, my wife began to panic, and while trying to keep my two toddlers calm, she finally convinced the rep to print her ticket. My wife rushed through security (of course having her hands inspected for whatever residue the TSA looks for), and got to the gate. The airplane was still docked, but the door was closed, thus she was denied boarding. My wife went around to a few different American Airlines desks to figure out what she could do and wasn't helped at all, rather, she was greeted with agitation, not sympathy or civility. Eventually, Alaska Airlines allowed her onto their next flight free of charge, which was a direct flight, and she made it home. However, she had to wait another several hours in the San Diego terminal with two toddlers to get onto that flight. American Airlines and their reps made my wife and two young kids miss their flight and couldn't care less. Alaska Airlines solved our crisis and didn't even charge us. Now I have my first airline credit card and it is from Alaska Airlines, as I refuse to fly with any other national airline anymore.";NEGATIVE

I go to customer service. The first agent said she would reroute me through Dallas but the plane was full, so I got a standby for 11hours later. I looked online and saw there were seats for another flight through Chicago and went back to request that, only arriving 3 hours late. This bored agent (not harried, there order for agents and me) said that their policy now was to when we re route through the same exact points so I was stuck on the next direct flight and could not be rerouted.  But either way one of them was lying through to me. The 2nd agent refused to fly me on the much more convenient flight she just said deadpan, ""welcome to the new American Airlines."" At least I am making my flight on the much later one on a rickety old US Airways plane which are prone to frequent breakdowns, which is why I refused to fly them before. 4-6 hour delays were too common. I can always hope for a upgrade to first class, however on these planes, the first class on domestic flights is like 1985 economy deluxe. The whole experience of having to sit in an airport simply because the agents refused to help reminds me of why I could never fly US Airways.

It baffles me that they don't have complimentary meals on a 5 hour long flight. The seat was really uncomfortable, and the leg room was not pleasing.

""I work for tip!"" He said. ""I'm sorry I have no cash,"" I said. ""Ha! You have no cash?? I work for tip!"" He said again. ""Leave me alone,"" I said. He then threw my suitcase on the ground and walked away. At this point it was midnight, my foot was in real pain and I was really offended by this.

Now that I've taken two flights on this new aircraft and spoken to flight attendants it is clear that American has chosen the wrong aircraft for this route. Firstly, although new, the setup is so flawed and poorly thought out on many levels. The entertainment system is problematic with constant reboots needed and a very clumsy operating system. The whole experience is like renting a car from a budget company and getting a new car which is clearly made as cheaply as possible. The most serious issue is that due to fuel requirements this aircraft very often has to move passengers away from the front of the aircraft when loads are light. A flight attendant confessed to me that it happens with regularity including evacuation of the entire first class cabin. This is not a safety issue but an issue of very poorly thought out choice of aircraft for route. That combined with the serious design flaws make it a strange experience.";POSITIVE

He proceeded to read us the riot act about being late before even hearing our side of the story. Fortunately some other travellers who were going through similar scenarios stood up for us and told the AA manager that we had indeed been on time and had spent over 1.5hrs in the check in line. The manager decided to help us after explaining AA was in no way responsible for any of our trouble. He got us to our gate just before the plane door closed. We had paid for an upgraded seat but lost that with no compensation and not even an apology. Our luggage did not make our flight and we were told in Phoenix it would cost us to have it delivered to where we were staying!

On telling them we checked 45 minutes before departure they said they had no control over the board and that we should have googled ""something"" to check on the Gate! Her attitude was belligerent, demeaning and in my opinion she should not have that job. We were put on a later flight that missed our connection. On arrival in Miami, we asked for hotel accommodation, or at least meal/beverage tickets for our 8 hour delay but were told they only did that for ""mechanical "" delays and not for people that missed their flights, again putting the blame on us.

It is very comfortable for sleeping although it could have a little more padding. Better than British Airways Club World seat in my opinion (BA is better for privacy if you are in a window seat). IFE and WiFi are very good, good movie selection and relaible WiFi (but it should be free of charge in business class, charging 17USD is borderline indecent). Food could also use a little improvement (love their ice cream sundaes though, which sadly weren't available on the inbound flight). There were no amenity bags for the MIA-LHR leg something I actually missed because I had most of my stuff in the checked baggage and I had no moisturiser at hand.

I could have taken a rental car to get to Austin, as it was closer to San Antonio. Instead, we had to wait 2 plus hours, fly back to Dallas and deal with it. After getting back to Dallas finally, they had only 2 concierce working a 75 plus person line. What was even more irritating was someone came down the line handing out a customer service number and basically said, this is what you will need to do. I called, was put on hold for 10 minutes and then hung up on. I called again, at which time they were able to get me on a 4:59 pm flight out of Dallas to Austin. Shocker, that flight was delayed until 6:59 p.m. and once on the runway was delayed another 20 minutes. Not once did someone say, sorry about your delay, not once was I offered an airport meal/beverage. I do not expect anyone to comp airfare, but the attitude displayed throughout the day was ""deal with it"" more or less. I will put my name to it though, as I am not one to say something and remain anonymous. ";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-11-11;"My American Airlines flight, together with 5 others, was cancelled due to pilots not turning up for work. Flight was due to leave 6.30 pm, I was finally in the hotel 12.30 am at the other end of Miami. Staff did not know what they were doing, it was general misinformation and chaos. I was put up for the night in average suburban Marriott (Fairfield Inn) while I had a nice hotel by the sea booked in Provo, which I had to pay for anyway. I had also pre-booked the following day's return flight to Grand Turk. When I asked customer relations at AA where to send invoices for refund on the Grand Turk flight and difference in the cost of the hotel, they refused, saying ""we have made a decision not to assume financial responsibility in situations we are unable to control"". They reassured me while re-booking me that it will not be a problem to get a refund by contacting Customer Relations. So they were lying bluntly! ";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-11-11;"Mistakes are understandable but this experience was beyond stressful. We usually pay more to fly on another airline because American is known for poor communication and organization. Huge mistake trying American again! We are still sitting in the airport for our flight, over 5 hours late. The worst part about it is that if it weren't for other passengers no one would have known about the delays. The women at the gate literally argued that there were no delays with people who had waited hours with no update. Leaving over 100 people scattering to change their connecting flights. The most inconsiderate airline I have ever experienced. It was this horrible 5 years ago and it has only gotten worse! Do not waste your money on an airline that does not take care of their patrons. The terrible customer service and communication ruins the experience for the whole family.";NEGATIVE

They offered no apology, vouchers for hotels, meals, a cab, and even said at the airport that we had to call reservations on our cell phones to rearrange connecting flights for the next day. As a teacher with a job I cannot miss, this was extremely inconvenient. No explanations were offered about the delay, except that the plane was arriving late from it's last location. The announcements of delays were very late, right around the 4pm scheduled departure time, well after they were informed of a delay (2:30pm, according to the national reservation office). This left no time to find alternative flights for the same day. I had to spend an hour in the lobby calling the national reservation office multiple times to check on flights from neighboring airports, even Dulles and Reagan International, several hours away, but there was no time (or vouchers for transportation) to get there.

The flight attendant rolled her eyes at me when I asked where the bathrooms were - rolled her eyes, pointed and said nothing. The bathrooms were dirty and toilets wouldn't even flush.

american-airlines;2015-11-09;"I have been an American Airlines frequent flyer for many, many years. I don’t fly the airline nearly as much now that we have moved to Hilton Head Island, since connections from Savannah are not in general as good as for other airlines to the destinations to which we fly. Recently my wife and I took a cruise from Barcelona to Lisbon on Oceania Cruise lines on which, as part of the package, they booked us on AA for outbound flights from Savannah to Philadelphia to Barcelona. As soon as I knew our flights, I went online to select seats, and the only ones we could get were the two center seats of the middle section (seat configuration 2-4-2). As my wife really likes window seats for transatlantic flights, I attempted to change seats at the check-in desk in Philadelphia. We were then able to get the G and H (side aisle and window) seats in row 35, the last economy row aft in the airplane. That is usually fine with us - quiet and a little more room. We flew those seats on Qantas for 14 hours to New Zealand. I sat in the aisle seat. I am 5’6” tall, 148 pounds. Even at my relatively small size, my seat was so narrow that it was impossible for me for to keep my left elbow inside the seat rest, especially during sleep. Since AA continues to pack seats in the plane, even at the back where the width of the fuselage tapers (where I was sitting), the width of the aisle was only barely wide enough to let the service cart through. Seriously, it is beyond belief that AA would just cram extra seats in the back and make people uncomfortable just to make a few extra dollars. As a result, my left elbow was hit almost every time the service cart went by, for the entire flight. So, while trying to sleep, I was bumped awake all night for every transit of the flight attendant and the cart. In addition, our flight attendant was stressed, terse, harried, and rude, from the very first interaction, indicating a lack of either appropriate personnel selection or inadequate training. American Airlines in-flight meal was at best mediocre, and their free alcohol selection abysmal – they offered only beer, or cardboard-boxed wine, far below the selections of other transatlantic airlines, even those that are US-based. We flew Air France home from Lisbon through Paris to Atlanta, and then on to Savannah. Our transatlantic flight featured large, leather, comfortable seats, excellent food, flight attendants, and choice of drinks, so that I know an airline can make money and make passengers happy at the same time. My wife and I paid $1100 for the privilege of enduring this awful, cramped, uncomfortable American Airlines flight, the same price as all the other economy cabin passengers flying further forward. I have sent a letter to American Airlines about this experience and can only hope that they look at the letter seriously and improve their service, seating, and staff. If not, I hope that their current flight standard eventually generates enough negative feedback that passengers choose other carriers and they go out of business. That way their routes and traffic can be taken over by other more passenger-friendly airlines (which are virtually every other one that we have flown). ";NEGATIVE

Exit row ""economy premium"" upgrade is a scam - hard, narrow seat with abysmal recline. I would never pay anything extra for this!

When I was talking to the representative on the phone I explained very clearly what I wanted, a window seat. However some time after booking our flight and before the day we were supposed to fly American Airlines changed the plane. That would not have been too bad if their email that was sent to me did not go into my Spambox. Getting ready to print our boarding passes, I saw this plane was a three seater and I had a choice of the aisle or middle seat! I wanted a window seat and made that very clear to the representative I spoke with when booking my flight. I called American Airlines and told them how upset I was and the rep said there was nothing she could do about it. I am stuck on their plane, it was impossible for me to book another flight with another airlines. When I got on the plane, I asked very quietly if I could have an extra seat belt. Well as I was walking to our seat, the staff member reach out and said Miss, here is the extra seat belt!  I was so embarrassed that I wanted to drop down and hide! Really, to have someone hand you a seatbelt in front of the rest of the passengers just showed me how unprofessional American Airline employees are. I am now on this plane in the aisle and anyone that passes me, hits me! This is what I had to endure the entire flight. We finally arrive and it couldn’t be soon enough. We walk to get our luggage and no luggage! We walk to the office and find out that American Airlines chose to put our luggage on another plane. The lady behind the desk tells us in one hour your luggage will be here. You can wait or they will deliver our luggage to where we are staying! Asking again how long will that take, she said only 1 Hour! Why did I believe her - arriving in New Orleans with heels on and warmer clothes because we were coming from Washington DC on this very uncomfortable flight, we asked to have the luggage delivered to our hotel.  After two hours I try calling their customer service to find my luggage. The lady tells me our luggage is at the airport waiting for a driver to deliver them.

Once she served the drinks, she came back with the snack basket and offered to passengers. She came around second time taking more drink orders and offered more snack. Snack on offer was pretty good: Kettle potato chips, organic oatmeal cookies, mixed nuts, etc. I wish there were fresh food like banana and apple but what on offer was more than sufficient for the 90 minute flight. Interior of aircraft well maintained although the seat pitch in first class is a little tight. I think it is maybe 38 inches, like premium economy on other international airlines. But the American Airlines Boeing 737-800 aircraft seems to have better pitch, I think maybe 42 inches, but the four extra inches make a world of difference. A couple of minor complaints, no hot towel service and no pre departure drinks. That is maybe I chose to board the aircraft last so I don't have to sit while waiting for the other 180 passengers to board and walked by me and knock me over with the oversized suitcases. One recommendation for American Airlines is that they should enforce cabin bags regulations as many passengers are cheap and chose to bring the oversize suitcases onboard rather than paying check baggage fees.

The flight attendant told me he was busy and could come back in a few minutes. Asked him again 5 min later. He could not care less! I gave up and carried the jacket on my lap the rest of the trip. Better than insisting with somebody that clearly is not prepared for his job. When I add this type of unprofessional service to the fact that AA charges substantially more than other Airlines on the same exact route (compare MIA-MAD on AA and on Iberia in Business for example), I wonder why I am still flying AA.

american-airlines;2015-10-26;"I booked a flight from Paris to Columbus, with a stop in New York (JFK). Shortly after booking my ticket, I noticed that American Airlines allowed just more than an hour to make the connection. Since I would be coming into JFK on an international flight, and would need to go through customs and re-check baggage before continuing on to my connecting flight. I become concerned about the time crunch and called American Airlines to verify that I would have enough time to make the connection. They assured me that I would, so I moved forward with the planned itinerary. When I arrived into New York from Paris, I was pleased that American Airlines had sent an employee to wait for me at the gate to give me an expedited pass through customs so that I could catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately, after clearing customs, I waited for an additional 30 minutes to get my checked baggage, so that I could re-check it. I literally ran the entire way through the airport to catch my flight. I arrived at my gate exactly 9 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off, but the flight was already gone. Not only was the door shut, but the airplane was already gone from the gate. This left me wondering why American Airlines authorized a flight to leave early when not all of its passengers had arrived at the gate. I was especially disappointed since I was traveling with my wife and infant son, and we were all very tired after a long day of traveling (we began our journey the day before flying with a different airline into Paris). An American Airlines agent at the gate kindly re-booked me for a flight the next day, but informed me that I would need to wait in the check-in line in order to ask about a hotel voucher. After waiting in line and speaking with a check-in agent about a hotel voucher, I was informed that since my flight from Paris was on time, they would not give me a voucher. I explained that I had run through the airport, and that the reason I had missed my flight was because my bags did not come through for more than 30 minutes after I had cleared customs. The check-in agent seemed to feel genuinely sorry, but reiterated that he would not give me a hotel voucher. Instead, I paid $300 to get a decent hotel on short notice. It is frustrating and unfortunate that American Airlines would feel it more important to avoid additional cost than to reimburse a customer for an expense that American Airlines had caused. American Airlines made two mistakes:  They authorized a flight to push off early, even though they knew they had passengers rushing from a connecting flight.  They did not give a hotel voucher even though they were late in getting checked bags to the carousel, resulting in a missed flight and need for a place to stay for the night. Nobody likes to be taken advantage of when they are vulnerable. This is how American Airlines treated me and my family. For this reason, I will avoid using American Airlines in the future when possible.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-10-26;"This was American Airlines flights from Miami to Norfolk via Charlotte. This was a previous USAir route for sure. Our departing flight was delayed by nearly 30 minutes, but thanks to modern unexplicable airline scheduling, we still arrived into Charlotte an hour before our connecting flight which was on time. American is really more of a no frills airline than the so called discount airlines. Both of our flights were on repainted USAir planes which had no in cabin entertainment at all, other than wifi which I did not bother to connect to. No snacks served either. Both of these planes, while clean, were definitely on the worn side. One thing I will add, is for the first time I used Americans mobile boarding pass. This can be obtained via their app or emailed. With this and not checking bags, I had absolutely no contact with any airport agents. I also slept on both flights so I had no inflight contact with flight crew. I saw people with paper boarding passes and thought, how 2000's! I ultimately arrived on time and safely into Norfolk. I guess thats the ultimate goal when flying domestically these days!";POSITIVE

I waited in the terminal and my flight kept getting pushed back. They would not tell us anything except that the plane was rerouted to San Antonio. About an hour and a half after we were supposed to board, they finally told us that the flight was cancelled and that we had to rebook. I went to the desk and they had me call the customer service number, which the woman I talked to wasn't helpful at all. I told her that I needed the earliest flight possible, but she kept listing flights that were extremely late in the day. I am 26 weeks pregnant, and didn't have any more money for food or a hotel room and they refused to give vouchers for food or a hotel, so I wound up having to sleep in the airport with nothing to eat. They finally got me on a flight, and we had taxied onto the runway, when the plane just stopped. No real explanation why. We sat on the plane waiting for it to take off for an hour, before we finally got off the ground. I will not be flying American again.";NEGATIVE

Arrived at airport early enough but line and service even for first class was so long and slow missed flight even though had already checked in and had boarding passes. Agent apologized and admitted they were slow because of cancellations in Dallas. Would not send my bags later and let me board flight. No curb service for bag.

The flight attendants did not conduct proper checks to ensure passengers seats, seat belts, cabin trays and computers were in fact ready for take off or landing.

I was told that I had to pay the exorbinant $200 change fee to go on the later flight which had more than enough room on it. They did not offer the normal $75 same day change fee, or an option to fly standby. I was told they did not offer standby on this flight, however when I got to the gate their were 3 other passengers on standby. I have done everything to get a refund for my fee, which I clearly should not have been charged, but the airline refuses to assist me regardless of my elite status and nearly 500,000 lifetime miles and 15 years of loyalty. Apparently American Airlines has such a horrible reputation for customer service that they just don't care anymore that consumers hate their business.

american-airlines;2015-10-19;"I'd award American Airlines zero stars if possible. Sunday, September 21,  Miami to Madrid, departure at 6:45PM with a code share on to Casablanca. At 4AM that morning, I am awakened by an automated call from AA, but with no recording - just silence. I check the web site, and the flight is delayed three hours to 9:45 PM. I get another ""mystery"" call waking me at 4:15 and another at 4:30. I shut off the phone. When our group of three gets to the gate that evening, we see the flight is further delayed to 11 PM (no explanation). We board only to find an aircraft that is beyond stuffy and hot - the temp must be in the upper 80s F (31 C). We're told the auxiliary power unit is malfunctioning, and there is a computer problem in the cockpit. By midnight, we're all soaked in sweat, and the temp we are old by an FA has reached 98 F (36 C), beyond union work rules. We're, told rather curtly, and in Spanish only, to get off the plane and wait at the gate. At 1 AM we're rushed back onto the plane. The pilot attempts to start the engines but the plane is plunged into darkness, with the emergency lighting cycling up only after about 30 seconds and the full lights not back on for five or more minutes (video never recovered). He tries this again, with the same result. Now passengers are demanding to get off. The gate agent comes on to give them a stern lecture that they will get no compensation or assistance if they leave since the plane has not been cancelled. At 2AM another attempt is made to start the engines, to no avail. Darkness, then chimes, then emergency lighting. All the while, the plane feels like a Hot Yoga tube. ""Folks,"" the captain said ""if we can just get the engines started we'll be just fine."" At 3 AM, the captain announces the flight is cancelled due to the failure of multiple APUs and FAA crew rules. Chaos reigns at the gate as there is no help with rebooking and announcements are in Spanish. At 3:45 we get our paperwork from the surly agent for the Iberia flight the next day at 5PM. We show up at 1PM only to be told by Iberia, a OneWorld ""partner"", that AA had not properly booked my seat nor endorsed the ticket over properly. (My friends were OK). I spent the next hour and a half running back and forth between the two airlines - they are about 1/3 a mile apart - while AA produced paper ""tickets"" that Iberia would not accept. ""These people are stupid!"" the Iberia guy complained - a helpful, competent, friendly soul so unlike the demonically possessed AA people. He writes down the instructions instructions for the AA idiots (with exclamation marks, no less) and I get the documents 40 minutes before boarding. By now all the seats are gone and I'm on standby. I do get on the Iberia plane - last seat - but after much stress and drama and a wasted $200 a night hotel room in Morocco, which AA will not reimburse. (An EU airline would). The return trip from Casablanca was a further nightmare, as AA ""damaged"" the record somehow. I found this out on a $38 phone call from Madrid back to the U.S. when the frequently down web site showed I was not on the MAD/MIA segment. Avoid this airline at all costs.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-10-19;"Bradley to Kansas City via Philadelphia. More than a little disappointed with American Airlines. First problem was the sitting arrangement upon ordering tickets online, we were forced to pay a higher fee for premium economy because we did not choose seating the day of original purchase - traveling with a 3 yr old and none of the open seats were next to each other, therefore we were hopeful that we could speak with someone prior to selecting seats to ensure my husband or I were seated next to our child, which we did get but had to pay the extra fee for the premium economy to ensure this. Where the tray table was broken and literally flopped down entirely into my lap and the seat was loose and sliding around under my rear. During our flight from BDL to Philly, our daughter (3 yrs old) had to use the restroom, my husband went to take her and was told by the flight attendant that they had to immediately return to their seats as we were descending and could no longer be up and about - those who have young children should understand, you cannot just tell a 3 yr old child to ""hold it"". What was further infuriating about this scenerio was that we were actually 30 minutes from descending and other passengers were continuing to be up and about to and from the restroom for another 15 minutes after this happened, yet my child was not allowed to go! I have no issues with the safety and rules of an airline but if you are going to tell one person to return to their seat then shouldn't this apply to all passengers?!? Our connecting flight from Philly to MCI wasn't any better, 45 minutes sitting on the tarmac due to delays made our 3 hour and 4 minute flight even longer. The flight attentants were rude and very short when addressed. Are they aware that they entered a public service occupation? After this entire experience, I would definately not recommend this airline for anyone. They have a lot of room for improvement in many areas!";NEGATIVE

We had to rent a car to get to Flagstaff then return to the airport in Flagstaff a second time to get our bags from the last flight of the day which was also late.  Our flight out of Flagstaff was delayed after they checked everyone through security and took our bags they informed everyone that the plane had a mechanical issue and was not able to take us to Phoenix. We again rented a car to drive to Phoenix after they booked us on another delayed flight which they failed to tell us about when they booked us on the flight.

Want to chose seats and check in - use BA flight number. Why can't I check in ? After 3 calls to BA's useless customer services"" we are told we can't check in online as it's closed to us, as we didn't select seats in time (news to me and never got any of this information from the website at the time of booking - nor did we get any warning notice telling us of the cut off point). All the more confusing as American Airlines allocated seat to us for the 2nd leg of the journey from JFK to Miami. Confused - we are ! We are offered the chance to pre book online for $30 per seat (what is this scam ?) but impolitely decline after spending a whole day online trying to sort it out. So just to be clear - the first part we have to pay for seats but the connecting flight we had seats allocated by American Airlines (at no cost). On the 2nd leg to Miami from JFK we are warned that, as per usual (in our experience on US domestic flights), there is a massive overbooking of cabin luggage and not enough space. As usual passengers refuse to give up their right to take endless pieces of baggage on with them so there is delay while ground staff literally confiscate baggage to put in the hold. Truly the indignation of tight fisted travellers with totally unrealistic expectations is a sight to behold. Everyone expects to get 2 pieces on board, regardless. No more internal flights for me, thank you. From now on it's British Airways or Virgin and damn the cost. The return flight (direct from Miami to JFK) - is it too much to expect that on a 10 hour flight we might get some inflight entertainment (and I don't mean 1 film). Truly pitiful. We board on the third group (not the last group) and guess what - no overhead locker space. Getting tired of this experience now. US airlines really have to sort this out and impose realistic expectations on their customers. Food average for economy, except the coffee which was really awful (I'm no coffee snob but how can you get this wrong American Airlines?) Cabin crew were okay to rude (congrats to the the one lady that really made the effort, on the other side of the plane). Got a nice warm ""thank you"" from everyone on departing the plane - but that doesn't make up for the previous 10 hours of mean spiritedness from the cabin crew. Ground staff very helpful and a simple, stress free experience. But really it's all about the flight - and American Airlines just don't cut it. It just seems US airlines are all in a race to the bottom (on price) and everything suffers accordingly.";NEGATIVE

The flight attendants and airport staff had zero personality and were not very friendly. I will do everything in my power to not fly with American Airlines in the future. To top it off, the only way to get in touch with customer service to file a complaint is via email. The representative who responded had no sympathy and basically told me to kick rocks.

We had a 6 hour wait in LAX for our ongoing flight so decided to use the American Airlines lounge. Fat chance! We were refused entry as we weren't members! Even after explaining that we were flying business class we were told we were not allowed in. Having flown all round the world over the last 20 years many times in business class, we have always had access to lounges. Not according to the American Airlines agent! So after biting our tongues, we eventually got onto the flight to Hawaii. What fun. The cabin service manager was rude and obnoxious. The food was the worst we have ever had, even flying economy. Even telling the Cabin Manager about the food, all she did was pick up the tray and make no comment. There was a young Hawaiian hostess who was sweet and smiled at everyone. So what was the problem with her boss? The seats were uncomfortable even though they were supposedly First Class. We had made the mistake of having front row 1D and 1F and we were so close to the bulkhead we couldn't stretch our legs. Don't have bulkhead seats! Return flight to LAX we changed our seats to non bulkhead which helped with the legroom. Went into the AA lounge in LAX and were greeted nicely and given access. We then asked why we were refused entry before, only to be told that it was a mistake as we had the right to use the lounge! We should have asked to see a supervisor to check our status! Pity they put untrained staff in a business lounge. Having got entry into a lovely quiet and spacious lounge we were disappointed to find a total lack of food except to crackers and cheese. We had been given 3 drink vouchers each so we could get something to drink. Why is it that other airlines give you no restriction on drinks? The next flight was from LAX to LHR on a new Boeing 787.

It was marked as 'delayed' and re-scheduled for 5:45pm departure.  At about 5pm I moved my seat closer to the gate counter to listen to the staff conversation about updates. They had probably a dozen conversations with maintenance people, pilots, etc  all in hushed tones to one another. Then, when someone would approach the staff, they would rudely say 'we know nothing - you'll have to sit back down and wait'. Super rude to nearly every person who approached to ask. At 7.30pm - after only 1 announcement over a speaker about what is happening, they canceled the flight. A long line of people had been waiting to talk to gate attendants for the last several hours, but most of the attendants were just beyond rude - no information, wouldn't look at people, just kept typing away for hours with nothing actually happening. We run down to the ticketing booths to get our flights re-booked. Of course, by this time there were no other flights to LAX that night. Again, if people had known an hour earlier that the chances were unlikely that they would get to LAX that night, they would have tried to get on another flight. As I wait in line I re-book a flight over the phone in 5 minutes. However, I then need a hotel voucher, as my flight left at 7am. After waiting in line at the ticketing booth for 2.5 hours someone finally provided vouchers to everyone waiting. 7After waiting for hotel shuttle to arrive for 45 minutes, a group of us finally pay for a cab to the hotel. We walk in at 10pm and the lone hotel staffer has no idea that we were coming, and also has no idea what airline vouchers are. They also only have 4 rooms available. As our group finally gets rooms a large group arrives from our plane with vouchers in hand, only to be told there were no rooms available. I'm guessing these people, after spending 8 hours waiting, just went back to the airport to sleep.  Again - things happen, planes get delayed/canceled by nobody's fault. However if the staff had been remotely professional and fore-thinking, they could have got people with important connections on other flights before it was too late.

I explained that I was requesting assistance because their website wasn't allowing me to make my selection. She said the only way she could help me without an extra charge was to transfer me to their technical assistance department and, if that person there could not help me, he/she could transfer me back to 'customer service' and authorize a waiver. Then, they could make my seat selection without charging me extra. The person at the technical assistance desk informed me that there were seats available at the quoted price, but that I had to complete my purchase, and select my seats 30 minutes afterward. It actually took eight hours to receive a confirmation, and I still could not make a seat selection. Once again I called 'customer service' and the rep informed me that the only way I could select my seats was to pay an additional $25 dollars per reservation. Otherwise, I needed to wait until the day of departure in order to be assigned seats at the gate. They could not even guarantee that we would be seated together. In light of the ridiculous two-day process of trying to get assigned seating, I asked to speak to a supervisor but was refused any assistance, refused to give me her employee ID (finally gave in after five or six requests), and refused to put me in contact with her supervisor. This is the first and last time I will fly American Airlines. Their flights are over priced and, based on their pathetic lack of any regard for the customer, their staff is over paid.

The entertainment system is the worst and their fleet is so old that the screen size could be trumped by some of the bigger phones in the market. There were a total of 10 movies on the plane and the choices were pathetic. The entertainment system is not personalized and they have shows running like in a cinema hall. So if you miss the show start, you join in between. The food was another issue. I had specifically asked for a AVML (Asian Vegetarian Meal) and they told me that they 'call' it VGML (Vegetarian Meal). Nobody from American told me that it is a simple vanilla vegetarian meal consisting of bread, butter, crackers and pasta when I was expecting some food I am used to. I had called American thrice to confirm this and they told me I am all set.  While I was slated to fly back from Chicago, the aircraft developed brake issues and they had to install new ones. This delayed departure by four hours. Every one hour, American would announce that they will tell us soon but even after boarding, we could not take off for 1.5 hours.

Lynn went to the gate folks and inquired about the flight, particularly because we had a connecting flight in Chicago to SJU. “No Problem” says the guy at the gate – the other flight is late, too, so all is well. You will have plenty of time. Our flight finally boards and departs – well over an hour late. In flight, the pilot announces that the delay was as a result of “crew rest time” as the original crew for this flight got in late the evening before.  We get to Chicago, go like hell to the gate for the SJU flight and get there just in time to see the aircraft preparing to pull away from the terminal. We were not allowed to board as the “door” closed 10 minutes before we got there. At that point, one of the AA reps hands us boarding passes for the next flight to SJU – several hours later. I ask “how about the connecting flight following that one?” Big blank stare, a look of shock on the guy’s face – he never looked to see if there was anything else on our itinerary. Now there is a supervisor involved, both banging away on the keyboards - they have nothing for today as there is only one AA sponsored flight a day into Dominica (DOM). Finally, out of the goodness of their hearts, they offer to put us up in San Juan for the night – but the catch is that the next available seats on Seaborne (AA affiliate) to Dominica are on 15 Oct 2015 –  a week away and they want us to sit in SJU waiting on the AA sponsored flight - then they offer to let us sit in Chicago! I was not happy. It was not our fault that the flight crew was so late getting us out of Omaha. We finally got new ticket vouchers for 15 Oct on the same set of flights as originally set up by Liberty Travel. One small point, our luggage is now missing in action – AA has no idea where it is – they are hunting. And the luggage cost me $50 for this mess. I hope it enjoys the trip. Later, when putting in a “claim” for our AWOL baggage, I find out from an AA employee that AA had no idea the crew was out of flying time and could not even find them in the morning? Had to have the hotel get them. At least that was the story from the ground crew personnel we talked to about the flight. We grab a ride from the airport back home.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-10-10;I spent almost 2-3 hours of my vacation on hold. When we landed I was told to call American Airlines two days before we left to change seats if they were available. I was told I could do it online. There website is a nightmare. Dis functional and impossible to use if you have an issue. It's impossible to email a representative. The list of questions they want is irrational. The site shut down and crashed on me because it wanted information I didn't have. I was unable to get information on seat upgrades. Then I called them and spent 45 minutes of my vacation on hold. Only to find out that.(this was on top of the 45 minutes I spent when we landed. I tried to upgrade the seats then but was told I needed to wait till two days before we left) so here I am on hold for an hour two days before we leave and they tell me that they cant help me and can't do anything because the seats were booked at an undisclosed rate.  They eventually helped me and scheduled a gentleman to call me. This process took 2-3 hours on the phone and a scheduled call two days later. Unfortunately it's impossible for me to get through to that guy from Ireland. The level of disgust I have is beyond words to describe and all I was trying to do is pay them to upgrade a seat to business class?;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-10-09;"I had booked American Airlines travel in advance for myself and family well in advance of our trip at a fairly decent rate. a month before travel, the airline removed a flight from our plan. After trying to find a flight to get us home, I booked one with Southwest (who I've never had issues with, props to them), and asked for a partial refund of the flight I wasn't taking with them. They refused. Gave me the run around with customer relations, then got told to request a partial refund with the refunds department, which I did, and then all my flights were canceled. I was then forced to rebook my trip at a higher cost of course. All the while, the admitted that their refunds department should not have canceled my flights. This trip ended up costing me almost $1000 more than my original booking. They didn't care. I waited until I returned from my trip to request again the money I'm out. After writing 6 letters to the top 6 executives with AA, I once again received a customer relations email (auto-response) that tells me I again, won't be granted a refund. I had asked for phone call or email from them.  I can't even fathom how much money over the years they have taken from their customers by doing this. I will never recommend this airline.";NEGATIVE

There were no weather issues whatsoever. The flight was rescheduled to depart at 11.35 am, and the gate had changed. Within minutes of arriving at the gate, the gate changed again, then again. The flight was then pushed back to 12.05 pm. Two hours past the scheduled departure time, we began boarding the flight. Not one American employee apologized for the inconvenience or explained the delay. I was miffed. I understand the American employees staffed at O'Hare were not to blame for the delay, but it would have been nice to recognize the delay was a huge inconvenience. Two days later, I received an email from American, asking me to review my flight from O'Hare to BWI. It was laughable. They couldn't even get my itinerary correct to review. In the future, I will bite the bullet and head towards Midway where at least Southwest has a far better on-time rating and employees that seem to care.";NEGATIVE

It literally had my name on every side of it, and my name and address on 2 tags. They forced me to check this bag. Don't even try calling their customer service, the people are rude and extremely unhelpful. Each of them told me different things and none of them lined up with what the other people said.

The issue is our originally scheduled flight was supposed to have an hour or so layover in Dallas Fort Worth and arrive in Miami at 11 am. However, American changed this flight to leave two hours later with a layover now closer to 4 hours and an arrival time in Miami of 1 pm. There was a flight that would leave 1 hour earlier than the original, but apparently we were defaulted to the worse one. Thanks American for ruining our return trip. You did not notify us of the change when it occurred. We only found out at checkin and were presented with no better options until we reviewed them on our own. When we inquired of the gate attendant to get on the earlier flight, we were told that our bags would arrive at the later time regardless, and there would be a $75 pp transfer fee. Nice and classy move American. Last time I fly with second class American Airlines. ";NEGATIVE

I swore I would never fly American again but I found a great deal recently and I thought I would give them another chance. I purchased travel insurance just in case and was ready to go. Unfortunately I just lost my job and when I called to cancel the flight I was told that there was a $200 service fee. She then explained that since my flight was less than that, I would just lose that money and not have to pay anything extra. When I told her that I would never be flying American Airlines again she got very rude and short with me. Apparently customer service isn't a priority for American Airlines.

Again, my only complaint was the in ceiling screens - couldn't really see all that well.

american-airlines;2015-10-04;"This is where my 4 flights of the week went downhill. First off, American Airlines changed the plane from a great A321 type that I flew out on to an old B757 - a much larger and much older aircraft. I thought I was sent back via the Twilight Zone. I hadn't flown in one of these in years! Anyway, pillow and blanket (neither of which I used) were at our seats. The seats were large but there wasn't any regular plugs to charge devices. Again, it was a 2 hour flight so no meal - just a choice of refreshments.  Entertainment was provided via overhead CRT monitors anchored to the ceiling over the aisle. CRT monitors! The ground crew were very good and organized since there were many people at the desk due to the change in aircraft. Luckily, my reserved seat was still mine - just not in the nicer A321. The cabin crew were younger but friendly and professional. The captain was funny on the PA system.  Overall and okay flight but thankfully short.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-10-04;I was amazed at the attention we received from our cabin attendant. She obviously has been flying for a while and she had this down pat. She introduced herself to each passenger as we boarded. We were served a drink and the warm nuts. I had placed my entrée order online and it was there for me - and very tasty. The seat was comfortable. My only concern was the plane having only the overhead screens instead of individual seatback screens. All in all it was very enjoyable trip.;POSITIVE

Being 15 and aware of the airline rules booked the seat -  when I arrived at the airport they said that I couldn't sit at the emergency exit. When I showed them the website and the rules they disregarded me and gave me a seat with less legroom. Being tall this was not the best way to go but I took the seat. Onboard plane it was filthy, no entertainment. We received an option of a banana or pretzels, a tiny cup of water and that was it. When II asked for more water he looked at me sarcastically. Premium economy had little extra legroom and not worth the upgrade.";NEGATIVE

They told me they would put me on a 5:30 AM flight so I could get to Dallas for a 6:05 PM flight to get home. I asked for a later flight. The rep told me they had to put me on the next available flight. I asked to speak to a supervisor. This is where it gets good. The rep told me he would leave a message for the supervisor. They might call me back within two hours. If I was not contacted within two hours I could call back and ask again. If not contacted within two hours I could call back and request again. I could follow this pattern until I was called back. I asked to speak to customer service. They told me I could email customer service and they would reply back in a couple weeks.

I can't explain the situation to the point of understanding, but I will never fly American Airlines again in my life if I can avoid it. Sure the flight was cheap, and I now understand why.

With no bags to check, we proceeded to security where I noticed that my boarding pass would not load on either the mobile app nor via the browser. I told my colleagues to go through security without me, and went to a nearby American Airlines kiosk to print my ticket. It did not work. I tried another kiosk which printed an error ticket, directing me to the counter. I did check-in from home earlier that day and had a reserved seat on this flight. Aware of the lack of time, I informed the check-in line rep of the situation, who referred me to the supervisor. She understood my situation but insisted I wait in the bag check line to print my ticket, despite 0 bags to check. When I said the delay would cause me to miss my flight she unsympathetically told me that I should have arrived 2 hrs early and walked away dismissively. At the counter, the agent printed my ticket easily with no explanation as to why it didn't work on my phone or from the kiosk. I went through security and sprinted to my gate, only to miss it by a few moments (walkway still attached), both of my colleagues aboard. Rebooking was apathetic and booked me standby for 7am.

american-airlines;2015-09-28;"American Airlines makes it almost impossible to speak with anyone in person, and now I know why. They do not want to be held responsible for any part of your flight experience which they did not provide well - which for me, was just about every one. The mechanics of the plane, quality of the flight attendant service, timeliness of the flight, etc. My son was smacked with the tray table from the seat in front of me repeatedly and no one cared to do anything about it. I finally just left it open so it could stop randomly falling on my infant (3 months old at the time). The flight attendant got annoyed and said I had to close it and I told her I would just as soon as she figured out how to get it to stop hurting my baby. She was rude and said she didn't know and didn't even apologize. Clearly, all they care about is taking your from Destination A to B, regardless if you get there in one piece or not.  If you get on the plane, then they have done their job, according to them. Do not fly with them if time or safety are your priority.";NEGATIVE

Onboard, the crew were friendly and jovial, the new Business Class seat is comfy, lots of storage, great IFE and Bose headsets. Wifi did dropout numerous times. The dining was second to none, compared to British Airways where a tray is thrown at you in Club World and the main course in overcooked and swimming in liquid.

Food absolutely terrible, especially on return leg to UK. Really cold on the flights.  Our return flight was over the Atlantic when a warning light came on and the Captain returned to JFK. You could hear the alarm screeching in the background of his speech to the passengers. Escorted to stand by Fire Service after brakes checked. Second worst landing I have ever had in 45 years of flying.  The landing in the replacement plane by the same pilot was only marginally better. The airline industry has moved on, especially the Middle East carriers, but American Airlines has not. I paid more for these 6/7 hour flights than I do for 14 hour flights to Asia.

We booked a multi-city trip with up to 8 days in a layover with our AA Advantage card, expecting to be charged for baggage on our international legs of the flight. But since we have the AA Advantage card, the domestic check is supposed to be free for the first bag for each person, up to 4, on the reservation. Well, American Airlines charged us for checked bags at every point. The agents claimed that we would have to call Customer Service to get reimbursed. Customer Service said that they could not do anything, so we have to go to the online site and leave a complaint. The American Airlines representative left a terse email stating that since all our flights were booked on the same itinerary, which included an international leg, we had to pay for checked baggage on every flight. We flew to 4 different cities in the US over the space of 2.5 weeks and were charged every time for baggage. What is supposed to be a benefit of our card that charges a $95 annual fee! So American is saying that we need to divide our travel reservation into international and domestic portions when purchasing our tickets in order to enjoy a complementary checked bag. The only perk: get 5% off if you buy the poor excuses for refreshments on American flights.";NEGATIVE

I found a flight on American Airlines that would have me at the airport for only 2 hours waiting but customer service said that the flight I wanted was not one of the choices, and if I wanted to go on that flight it would be $400 extra. I could drive back home from Chicago in a rented car and it be less than that! Then arriving to the airport I found out I could change my flight and be standby for $75. I was put on the list as number 8 and was not able to catch the earlier flight. ";NEGATIVE

Rubbish single aisle TV so no personal media options. AA is not keeping its side of the One World agreement. This would never happen on BA and Qantas.

american-airlines;2015-09-20;"Las Vegas to London Heathrow via LAX, and I initially booked this fight with a 2 hour changeover in LAX. I had concerns when received an email from American Airlines advising of 45 minute changeover, I sent several emails advising of concern, their response was to request I call them in USA. I find it strange that a company that you are paying good money to, contacts you by one option but then you have to contact them by another, I feel this needs to be addressed, I never in the end used the phone as I have had to do this with other airlines wasting time and money and just hoped all would work out. Checked in at Las vegas 3 hours before flight and was told there was no Business Lounge for American Airlines, strange as their main competitor has one and there are other lounges which you can pay to go into, why does AA not do this? The internal flight to LAX was ok, plenty of legroom in Business seats with some recline, we were provided with a bag of chips and a drink. Changeover at LAX was very efficient, arrived at gate next to where we had to get our plane to LHR, arrived with 10 minutes until boarding started. Boarded plane with no greeting from cabin staff they seemed to be engaged in conversation with each other, this caused issues when seating as my wife had to go all the way back to the front. Seat was a great set up, same as Cathay Pacific. Good seat storage, good choice of movies on large screen and comfortable seat and bed, although those over 6 foot might find ther feet feel restricted with limited foot space when in lie flat mode. Cabin staff were efficient and professional although they were not vey welcoming and did not smile - I managed after many contacts to get a smile from a hostess, but it seems to me that most do not want to be doing this job? It is strange that American Airlines would not choose to focus more on customer service especially as this is their new flagship plane. Suitcaes arrived at detination which was good. Overall experience was reasonable with food and seating being the best part of the experience.";NEGATIVE

This encourages you to pay extra so you can sit together on a long flight. I am suspicious that they do this deliberately, and if so, this is a particularly cheap and dirty trick. Also, we were placed in the rearmost row, meaning you get no choice of meal when they run out of one meal option. When I asked if this is going to happen for every meal for the whole flight, the attendant was rude and said, of course - hadn't I ever flown before? An apology would have sufficed. We found the staff dismissive, talking amongst themselves while customers were disembarking instead of saying goodbye like they do on other airlines. They're clearly not a quality liner, and we won't be looking to fly with them again.";NEGATIVE

Re-routed via MIA on flight that got us to SJU seven hours later, which meant we missed an entire day of vacation. After asking about our bags (nobody communicated anything prior) had to reclaim bags and recheck with just 30 mins before MIA flight departed.

I was so irritated and we had to scramble to find another flight, deciding whether or not we would take another flight the next day or book another flight on the same day. Then we decided to book another flight to Chicago. We had to fly to 2 places before we officially got to Turks And Caicos! From Boston to Chicago then from Chicago to Miami and then from Miami to Turks And Caicos! Absolutely terrible. As if this wasn't bad enough, the planes were extremely old, and it looks as though they haven't been cleaned in a long time. Interior of the planes we flew were worn out, dusty and grimy. No personal TV's. The only TV's were those old fashioned TV's hanging from the ceiling every few rows that are largely defunct nowadays I was sitting pretty far away and couldn't even watch what was on there. Seats were old, worn out and very uncomfortable. Food was just terrible. Flight attendants were rude and had a bad attitude, making the flight even more miserable. The bathrooms were small and dirty. The return flight was somewhat better, but still quite unpleasant. We had to go the same route all over again. American Airlines is among the worst airline I have traveled. ";NEGATIVE

We were told we missed the connection due to bad weather conditions, and apparently bad weather conditions is the fault of the passenger! Most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Cabin crew just seemed like they couldnt be bothered and were rolling their eyes at passengers, signing loudly and treated us very badly. Two staff members even had an argument in front of passengers. So unprofessional. Never fly with American Airlines, they make your journeys thoroughly unpleasant.";NEGATIVE

We expressed concern about making our connecting flight, they told us it would be fine. It was not fine, we missed the flight, we landed at 7:00 am in Dallas, the flight was scheduled for a 7:05am take off, they left early at 6:58am. We were sent to 3 different gates trying to get on flights, had to rush with our bags all over the airport and finally had to settle for flying into Reagan rather than BWI where our car was. We agreed to this because the 2 women working with us said the airline would reimburse us the $55 shuttle ride if we wrote to them,. We were not offered a voucher for food at the airport or for a shuttle like we saw other customers being offered. I was just informed by customer service that they will not reimburse as it is not their policy, but they did try to give us two $100 vouchers to use on a future flight. If I was going to fly anywhere within the 1 year they give us to use them, I would not be doing it with American Airlines and $100 will not get you far with their prices. Do yourself a favor and go with a different airline. On top of all this they will put you in the oldest plane they can find for a 7 plus hour trip to and from Hawaii, and no WiFi of course.";NEGATIVE

Did we have to rush to get a connecting flight to Orlando. Security at JFK is a nightmare and we got on plane with minutes to spare. Closed the door, taxi out but then everything stopped and sat for another 1.5hrs. Got to Orlando, circle over Daytona for 1 hour land and then yet more time waiting to get to the terminal.

Next we have the bathroom, which I will say is the worst! It was so tight and dirty.  The food was disgusting and sloppy (Photo). The seat in front of me, the trim was lifting and not even attach to the seat(Photo).  Where I was seating exactly, the air vent was without the turning knob to adjust - just 2 holes!

The A320 can easily fly for over 4 hours. While over Wichita Falls, the pilot announces that he is low on fuel and has to divert to Wichita Falls. Later, the pilot comes over the intercom and tries to explain that it is because of weather around Dallas. Savvy passengers on the flight check this and find there are no current delays at DFW. Why does he not have enough reserve fuel? Maybe the FAA should look into this. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight to Richmond from Dallas. American Airlines had only 2 customer service reps to process about 125 angry passengers. It was after midnight when we got our new airlines tickets for our continuing flight. Our flight was 9:30AM the next day. American Airlines offered us a hotel, but at our own expense. No food vouchers were ever offered. American Airlines left us stranded waiting for our next flight. This was not the passengers fault. Just saying sorry just doesn't hack it. So this is the new American Airlines? I'm not impressed.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-09-16;"Minneapolis to Chicago on American Airlines, in Economy class on a vintage MD80. Friendly check-in, where the agent worked with me to avoid the USD 100 surcharge because my hold luggage was initially 8 lbs over American Airlines 50 lbs. limit. This was appreciated. After that the experience became distinctly mediocre. Once boarding was completed the pilot announced that there will be delay due to a maintenance issue that they have not been aware of before. So a packed plane waited for the maintenance issue to be solved, which thankfully “only” lasted 40 minutes. Plane has obviously not been cleaned in MSP, as the seat pocket was full of stuff including used tissues and something sticky and disgusting.  Otherwise the flight was uneventful. Legroom was ok due to Economy ExtrAA seats, but service was very average. Flight attendants not exactly unpleasant, but not particularly friendly, either and not doing more than the absolute minimum. No snacks were served (also not expected as this being the US and the flight time was below 90 minutes). Drink service was limited to coffee, water and orange juice, which is pretty poor for a flight of this duration. Bags out fast in ORD with priority bags first. In general the flight as such was OK. Pretty much like taking a bus. However, due to the delay a lot of people were very anxious to reach their connection out of ORD. The only assistance from American Airlines staff seemed to be an announcement to “remain seated, if you do not have a transfer connection to catch”. Sorry state of affairs in the US skies, but American Airlines is still my default airline for domestic flights, as staff normally seem to be willing to assist, if help is needed.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-09-16;"This flight from New York JFK to Las Vegas was a reward flight using frequent flyer miles, so only cost $10 for me and my partner. However, we were very disappointed with American Airlines service. The flight was delayed from leaving the gate due to a paperwork issue, but the cabin attendants did not do anything to ease our discomfort (the plane was getting hot due to reduced air con while still at the gate). After we got airbourne (2 hours late) the trolley came around with refreshments, but most food items had sold out completely (only nuts or chips remained). We were seated mid aircraft so feel there was never anywhere near enough food in their stock for this 6 hour flight. Also, the trolley only came around once which is not enough on this length of flight in my opinion.";NEGATIVE

We usually don't care about the food on the plane, we don't wait to fly to get a good meal, but on the flight from Kona to Lax when asked if ""pizza"" was ok, my husband asked what was the other choice and the answer was ""pizza only""!  At least don't call it First Class. We will never fly American again if we have other choices.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-09-13;"I was forced to fly from Orlando to Dallas/Fort Worth just get back to Pensacola. It doesn't make any sense to fly over my city just to get back to my city and add four hours. I accepted it and moved on. The reason why I am writing this review is because I arrived at Ft Worth about 15 minutes later than the flight expected. things happen, and I understand that. But when I arrived I almost immediately heard my name over the intercom for a final boarding call to Pensacola. I was told I had 10 minutes to reach the gate or I wouldn't make it. I made it to the gate I was instructed to reach in less than 3 mins. It was the wrong gate. They told me the incorrect gate both on the plane and over the intercom. SO when I finally found airport staff they told me the correct gate. Luckily it was just a few down. I got to it with more than five minutes to spare in my 10 minute time I was given. I walked up to three personnel from American Airlines and they didn't even want to break out of their personal conversation to help me. When I said ""I heard my name, I'm here to get on"" they told me they had just closed the gate and that I would need to be re-booked. The girl who locked me out of the flight didn't even want to help me get re-booked. She pawned it off to another employee as if it was a chore. He didn't even look me in the face the entire time and told me that I would need to fly at 8.30 that night if I wanted to fly today. I asked how to file a complaint. All he said was ""go online"".

american-airlines;2015-09-12;"Typically American Airlines is my preferred airline, but now that I have had to work with their customer service department I question whether I will ever fly with them again. I was issued a voucher a year ago and it says redeemable at the ticket counter or by calling. As the expiration date approached I contacted them a few days before it expired to inquire about extending it. They said no. This was fine. I located a flight and booked it and then called again (September 2nd) to ""purchase"" the flight. At this point I was informed that I needed to begin my travel on that day or else lose the voucher. This travel requirement had not been previously communicated. Also, I was told they needed 2 weeks processing time so the voucher was no longer any good since I was not able to travel immediately. Had I known I needed to travel by a specific date I would have. If I knew that I needed two weeks to allow them to process the voucher (via mail) I would have gone to the airport directly. The vouchers do not come with these instructions. So I have used their poor website tools to communicate. First, I ""emailed"" customer service with no reply. Second, inadvertently I ""emailed"" ""customer relations"" (who knew they were different?). This second communication got things moving. I was told we have no record of the first email. So I| sent them the tracking number, to which the replied basically, ""oh yea, it's expired. Nothing we can do. Sorry. Keep flying with us though"". I have since resubmitted an ""email"" to them via their website. This is a horrible practice and outright poor communication on behalf of American Airlines.";NEGATIVE

I spend a lot of money with them in my business, not sure if that is connected though. This is their A320 shuttle between LAX-JFK, replacing larger Boeing 767, which I used to fly. It cannot be compared. Seats are great, comfortable. The only illogical thing is USB / Headphone plugs and cell phones which is behind your seat, to make space in front. But it is a little annoyance. Food is great, better than on international AA flights I take from LAX-LHR. They had great starters, good wines and fresher food options. AVOD great, good sized personal TV.  AA is going the right direction, I just hope they don't become complacent again. The competition is tough and I recently tried Mint by JetBlue, which I dare to say was even better.";POSITIVE

Other airlines notify customers of changes. On top of that, the rep at the counter was extremely unhelpful and booked me on a flight that I told him wasn't going to work.

I can't believe I chose them for my round trip, too. Some staff were nice, but many were rude.  In fact, there was a front desk agent who was on his phone the whole time while I needed to get my flight changed.  Every time I asked a question, he would answer like he was offended and I'm known to be one of the most polite people out there. He has basically inspired me to write this review. The only reason why they're not a flat out 0/10 is because there was one woman who found my wallet, came back all the way just as I was about to board my flight. If it wasn't for her generosity, I don't know what I would do. But I can definitely say she can move to a better airline considering her qualifications and the level of service she offered.";NEGATIVE

Great catering,  Dublin - JFK I had the best steak on a plane. Generous meals were served on the long domestic legs. Crew offer drink top ups. The seats Dublin - JFK were old angled seats, fine for daytime flight but I wouldn't like to travel overnight with these. The full flat seats between JFK and LAX on the new A321 were superb. The old recliner seats LAX-HNL-LAX flights were nothing to write home about but a step up from shorter haul business class in Europe. only thing that could have improved for me would be handheld IFE units given out to customers in First Class on LAX-HNL legs. The flights are around 5.5-6hrs and this would have vastly enhanced the experience.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-09-10;"La Paz to London via Miami. The main reason for this review is that American Airlines now check your baggage through. After booking the flights, I had a warning from a friend that you not only had to go landside when transiting, but you had to collect your bags to check in again. I had minimal time in (Dallas on the way out) Miami and AA reservations confirmed that baggage could not be checked through. They now do so and I made the LHR flight with about 30 minutes to spare (unhelpful immigration staff). The flights were uneventful and unimpressive, but cheap and got there in reasonable time. The only real gripe is the entertainment system. The Boeing 777 flights provide a woefully short number of films, documentaries, comedies, dramas and any choice would get a 'you want to watch it from 20 minutes in or wait for the next one in 10 minutes?' Sound and picture quality are very poor. The Boeing 757 flight from La Paz was a throwback to the 80's - fold down screens in the aisle, where you will watch the only showing, unless you're sitting in a window seat and you can't see the screen anyway. Point I did like was that, for a cheap cost, you can buy a better seat well in advance. As said, my flights to Peru and back from Bolivia were a lot cheaper than alternatives so if that means the TV options are rubbish, so be it.";POSITIVE

No plug or usb for charging or wifi - so we can't even use our own personal device to watch or do something else besides watching the 1movie on the overheard TV screens on the plane because we can't charge our devices and will be dead in an hour on a 10 hour flight!

Again the flight boarded on time and we were greeted  by the cabin crew, found our seats and to our surprise there was even more leg room than the first flight. The cabin was also fresh, clean and bright. Departure was delayed by an hour due to a technical fault with something to do with the fuel. Once up and away the inflight service commenced and free drinks were served which I wasn't expecting for an internal flight. The entertainment was in overhead TV's but I didn't expect seat back entertainment on a smaller plane. I didn't even expect TV's on the plane.

The day got off to a bad start with a 2hr queue for checking in at Manchester airport, and then to find out that the seats that my wife had booked online (window seats) were then not available to us and we were put in the centre section - although one of us would be sitting by ourselves, this was rectified on board with another passenger who kindly swapped. The flight was on time and we made it with 20 minutes to spare thanks to the mass chaos at check in, the plane looked new and clean from the outside, but once inside the aircraft all that changed, and you stepped back in time to the 1990's. The cabin was dreary and their was also a stale smell in the air (like a pub carpet), and also the entertainment system may have well been non existent with the overhead TV's (no seatback entertainment here). The flight was good, the cabin crew were good - friendly and no attitude, the food was good, and also the refreshment service was no problem (free drinks). The seats may have been old, but they were spacious and plenty of legroom in front. Would I fly with AA again - if I got the same level of service then yes, if it was a dirty aircraft that desperately needs dragging into the modern age for a long haul flight then no.

The most annoying thing is when traveling via Miami, American loves to fill the aircraft with a ton of cargo so much so that flight will often be delayed departing, meaning a missed connection in Miami. Seems American loves to put people in Hotels in Miami from delayed flights. My recent flight from DFW via Miami catching American Eagle to GNV, I nearly missed with the connection because American in DFW decided to load a ton of cargo onto the Boeing 777-300ER. Granted the plane was flying onwards from Miami to RIO, but most of the passengers were making connections in Miami to other US cities via American Eagle. As the flight was delayed 1hr in DFW while a full plane sat on the ground, by the time the food for purchase came around the food had run out. So much so that the cabin crew started giving out free snack items. As to the delay from DFW, American was nice to give each person the full can of soda or Juice, and the pilots took us over the gulf to so we could reach Miami quicker.  Once landed in Miami everyone ran to D60 where all the American Eagle flights depart with a mad rush for the sky train to make the connections. ";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-09-03;"Chicago to Minneapolis in American Airlines First class (due to upgrade) on an MD80 (an old plane, but seemed well maintained and comfortable for this short flight, with standard First class seats).  Flight on time and no drama. Cabin staff in First Class was attentive and trying to give a good experience. Coffee/Drinks and some pre-packaged cookies were distributed for breakfast. Check-in in ORD was slightly weird. I was using economy check-in kiosks, as they were closest to the door where I entered the airport and had no lines. The first two machines did not work and froze immediately. Going to the next machine I was approached by an American Airlines employee and asked if I needed help. “Probably not, if this machine works”. The third machine finally did work. However, I got a lecture by this officious person that American Airlines requires to be at the airport at least two hours before the flight and actually three hours is needed to make the flight. Aside from the fact that he did not know or ask my departure time or flight number or anything else before lecturing me and the whole area was not busy at all, he was just delaying me while doing the check-in. All officious, surly and completely unwarranted. I finished check-in, went through TSA within 15 minutes and still had more than one hour left to wait at the gate before boarding started. Priority bags out first in MSP. Except for this weird encounter during check-in, the flight was ok, but of course no way near a First Class experience. Also, of course good value due to the upgrade.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-09-03;"I was flying out of Maui and it took several American Airlines agents to figure out how to issue the boarding passes for my family and check our luggage from Maui to Ottawa. We waited from 7.15pm until 8.50pm for them. We were originally scheduled to fly with United as part of a code share with Air Canada. At the airport, when we checked in with UA, they informed us of the changes and sent us to AA counter as our trip from Maui to Los Angeles was now with American Airlines. The agents sent us back to UA. The agent at UA was very helpful, printed the itinerary for us and told us that all the information was in order. In the end, the AA manager made some phone call to figure out how to issue our boarding pass and check in our luggage. They could have done that within the first 20 minutes instead of wasting our 1.5 hours in that hot airport. We did not receive any apology. When they issued our boarding passes, our family of four were split into 3 groups, when there were 3 empty rows (9 seats) at the back of the plane. When I walked to the back of the plane and asked the stewardess about putting me and my husband back there, they said no. My guess was those seats were kept for them to sleep/use for storage during the flight. Crew service was average. It was a red eye flight so there was little service required. The crew did not greet the customers on arrival and departure. I will avoid AA in the future.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-09-03;American Airlines is not the airline it used to be and has gone downhill since the merger with US Airways. My wife and I were recently on a smaller plane from Hartford to National and my wife could not make the flight. When I called to see if they would change the flight for her I was told it would cost an additional $200 plus the difference in the cost of the ticket. I expected this and had a fall back of a $60 fare with another airline. Told myself I would enjoy the extra room on the cramped seats with the seat next to me being empty. American Airlines decided to put someone in the seat and after I told them I had paid for it and wanted to use it was told too bad they could take it. So this seat was paid for twice. Once by me and again by another passenger.;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2015-09-01;"I am so disappointed in American Airlines and their customer service. On August 26th I left from Vancouver to head to LAX. I was supposed to have a 51 minute layover before I jumped on my next flight to Denver. This was not going to be a problem, I was assured by many staff members that our arrival gate was right next to my departure gate, I did not have any luggage only a carry on, and did not need to go through security, just simply get on the flight. As I boarded my plane, we were told that we would have to sit there for another 45 minutes because LAX was under construction and was not ready for us to arrive at our estimated time. This made my connection now only 25 minutes before departure of my Denver flight, but again I was reassured by staff that this would not be an issue. Upon arrival at 9pm (25 minutes before departure of next flight) the pilot informed us that even though they were aware there were many who needed to run to their connecting flight, we were unable to get off. By the time we got off the plane and ran next door to our gate, American Airlines flight to Denver had already closed the door. I ran to the staff member right away as I was only a minute or two behind the designated ""door closing"" time and was rudely dismissed and told there was nothing that could be done. After waiting 20 minutes, a member came and helped me reschedule my flight for the next morning at 6.30am. Seeing as it was 9.30 pm, I would need accommodation for the night. American Airlines offered zero help with accommodation. In result, seeing as my flight was very early in the morning and I needed to be there the night before, I had to stay at a hotel close by. I contacted AA about this issue, but my complaint and request for reimbursement was dismissed. I will never fly AA again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-09-01;"After boarding the American Airlines flight, we were kept on the plane, sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours. There were vague updates every 45 minutes and the flight attendants knew nothing about what the hold-up was. We were told that something minor had to be fixed and then were told that paperwork was being wrapped up but we had to wait another 45-60 minutes for this. Whenever the flight crew made an announcement, it didn't sound like they really knew what was going on. To top off the fact that they kept us trapped on the plane for that long, the flight attendant only came around one time to give us one small glass of water. Then 1.5 hrs after we took off, they offered us another glass of a complimentary beverage (after we took off the plane felt very stable in the air but apparently the pilot ordered that beverage service not start for a long period of time - no reason was provided). Overall, the way American Airlines crew handled this situation was very disappointing. They came off as incompetent. That entire experience was awful.";NEGATIVE

Once there, just over half an hour later they informed us that the problem was solved but they had to consult with Dallas if the flight crew could conduct in question or not. Minutes later, they told us that regrettably could not make the trip and moved all the passengers to a hotel with expenses paid. Moreover, we confirmed that the flight would leave the next day at 9:00 AM and we had to be at the airport at 6:00 am in order to embark. What is our surprise now, in the hotel where we are staying, they have been placed for a notice explaining that the flight will start tomorrow at 9:00 PM by decision of the pilot.

american-airlines;2015-08-29;"Paris CDG to New York JFK I only flew American Airlines because all of the one-stop flights from Cairo to New York via Qatar Airways were full, and I figured that one transatlantic flight on American Airlines was worth it to experience Qatar Airways business class between Doha and CDG. Boarding was slightly problematic. They announced business class boarding, and when I walked up to go through, I was rudely told that only business class passengers were boarding. It was assumed that due to my appearance that I couldn't possibly be a business class passenger, but once they realized the mistake, no apology was forthcoming. The plane was obviously old and the IFE personal entertainment screen was small, with a very limited selection of movies and television shows. When ""The Good Wife"" is the most interesting series available, there's a problem. However, the seat worked, and the flight attendants were nice, even though they didn't go the extra mile- everyone had to take care of their own carry-on and put it in the overhead bin. My special Halal meal was great, for both the main course and snack selectio"". My main course was similar to everyone else's in terms of presentation, but my snack was even better - instead of the Croque Monsieur Sandwich or Thai sandwich that the other passengers got, I got an awesome shrimp dish. The flight wasn't bad, per se, but if you're going to fly business class, there are many better airlines out there.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-08-29;"London Heathrow to New Orleans via JFK, LGA, CLT, DFW, on Boeing 777-300ER, A321/319 and Canadair RJ900. I had a code share flight from Geneva with British Airways but I had to change terminal which meant clearing security again - American Airlines has very few European connections at Heathrow so I'd rather transit elsewhere, given the choice. While free wine and beer is a welcome addition in economy class, the food is still lacking in quality and served in little black boxes that give an industrial feel. Integration with US Airways is incomplete. I had a domestic flight segment operated with a US Airways flight number but an aircraft with American Airlines livery on the outside (and US Airways inside) and there was no way to know whether I'd have to pay for my luggage. It ended up costing me $25 from LGA to MSY - no prior warning (and another website that declared the charge would have been cheaper overall). Change of airport required for a connection in New York so I spent a few days there. Generally the cabin crew were pretty friendly and I appreciated the interiors in the new Boeing 777-300ER with individual IFE. On the way home, they would have wanted me to pay $25 to choose any other seat on my flight from MSY to DFW but the back row. $75 to choose anything but a middle seat between DFW and LHR. I thought this was stingy, especially since I checked in early. Also, when I tried to check in online, the AA website sent me to US Airways and then US Airways sent me back to AA. With my BA legs I had 3 different booking codes (I had to find the US Airways one from Check My Trip). Flight out of LGA was late - the captain never came on to explain why it took so long to taxi to the runway - but the crew were great, eg. making people change seats just before landing so that anyone with a tight connection got an aisle seat. Overall I felt that this experience was not bad. better than United but I would always choose a European Airline over American Airlines if I could. A lot of disabled people were helped by the ground crew which was good. While the apps were pretty bad in the sense that check in was hard and so was getting my own boarding pass - it's not possible to download it to the app. I did. however, appreciate the Wifi luggage checking facility - you can scan your baggage tag and see if your bags made it to the plane through the onboard wifi.";POSITIVE

As for the plane itself well where do I start, a 7 hour flight to New York, no TVs , no radio, no inflight entertainment whatsoever. We were given an extremely thin blanket a pillow so small a 2 year old would have struggled to use it. The food was horrendous.

Firstly I had a problem with my initial flight to UIO on a different airline but same alliance (One World) on an unlinked itinerary - zero assistance from American - I would be still be in Ecuador only for the help from LAN Ecuador. Rude, unhelpful and petty rule driven check in employees at AA in Quito Airport causing long lines at check in. Old B767 - my standard overhead carry on bag would not fit in the bins. In Flight Entertainment was limited to an old overhead screen about 20"" Poor food offering - meal service took over an hour to be cleared and there was no further beverage service through the flight.

Also, who would have guessed that there isn't a backup plane available. So now we have to wait until 8pm for another plane to fly from Dallas to pick us up. Does it take 6 hours to fly from Dallas to Seattle? I think not. We are notified that we will miss all our connecting flights. The next seats available to Des Moines aren't until Tuesday or Wednesday. Well that isn't going too well with our employers, so we negotiate through a supervisor with ""finance"" to get reimbursement should we fly to another city and take ground transport home. BTW, we were offered snacks for sale and a movie headphone for sale while we were on our flight with 200 passengers that also sat at the airport all day waiting for this flight. Absolutely rude. Okay so we were up all night flying and arrived in nearby city at 9:30am on Monday so we could drive home 2 more hours. We were sleep deprived but finally home around noon on Monday.

american-airlines;2015-08-26;"The new American Airlines business class on the Boeing 777 is very good with two exceptions. First, catering needs a serious upgrade. The food was barely edible, and I must admit although I like ice cream for dessert, my expectations are a bit higher when travelling business class on a long-haul flight. The so called ""Champagne"" is Prosecco, which is a fine Italian product, but not Champagne by a long shot. I would suggest that American Airlines should either offer the real thing, or call it Prosecco. My second exception has to do with the comfort of the seat. It is great for sleeping, but for day-time travel it is not very comfortable. ";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-08-26;"This is an impressive and smooth aircraft and I had waited months to my first AA787 experience. For that reason I flew from NY to Buenos Aires via DFW. I've flown other 787s and this aircraft's first impression is created by the incredible effect of its smart lighting and design. Boarding AA's 787 from DFW to EZE was nothing like it. The cabin was quite dark and it felt very cold and claustrophobic. Overall the crew showed a lack of knowledge of the product and did not know how to help passengers enjoy the excellent experience flying a 787 is in itself. AA's 787 has, in my opinion, very decent and comfortable seats (I slept over 7 hours) and great personal space. But entertainment did not work for a portion of the flight and crew members did not seem to know how to fix it. Service was very slow and very impersonal and it seemed as if it was short of 1 or even 2 crew members. There was nothing memorable about the food, but who flies AA for its culinary virtues? So it was ok. Although I did not pre-order my breakfast before falling sleep, I was fully awake when that service started, yet they skipped me, and I was informed that because I did not tell them a few hours prior that I wanted to eat in the morning, they might not have much left for me (at the end I was served the full meal). I loved being on this aircraft and will look forward to my next flight in it. Too bad AA is missing the opportunity of incorporating decent service to an amazing aircraft in order to deliver the wow factor of other carriers' 787 operation. Beautiful brand new plane and very smooth ride with the poor service of and old 767-200.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-08-25;"This summer my family and I took a vacation to see Europe. We chose an overnight flight so that our children could sleep and the first row so that we could have more room and be comfortable. Needless to say my girls fell asleep and my two year old laid down under our feet on the floor and fell asleep. The seat belt sign was on pretty much the whole flight with no turbulence. My two year old, as mentioned before, was completely out of the way so passing people and airline staff had a clear path way but I was continually harassed instead of helped by staff telling me that policy states she can not be on the floor with the seat belt sign on. Thus, I had to wake up a peacefully sleeping child who then cried and disturbed others. If I could have come up with a better solution I would have but the hand rests on these new planes do not move up in the front row due to there being TV's in them and the seats only go back so far. On the flight back the movie was acting up and instead of going to check to see if it could be fixed they just said that nothing could be done about the bad quality of the movie. This is not the first time I have had such an experience with American Airlines. Their customer service is terrible and they should be ashamed of treating customers that way and have a little more compassion for traveling parents with children.";NEGATIVE

Entertainment system was ok, didn't had many movies that were my style but then again the fact that you could swipe over the screen to change between movies, games etc, was great. Food was poor, especialy the breakfast on the flight from SJO to DFW. Also switching between airplanes in DFW was awful but nothing American could do about.

The flight was delayed overall by at least an hour, we spent the majority of the delay time sat waiting to set off due to a ""Minor repair"" which was announced by the pilot over the tannoy once we were on board quite some time later. Our delay continued probably due to missing our take off slot, it wasn't clear because no-one really explained what was happening. Within this time period, the cabin crew turned up and suggested we should move to another seat, we'd been settled into our seats for 20-25 minutes and had chosen seats towards the rear of the plane close to the toilets. When we tried to reserve a seat together before flying, it was fairly limited at the time and we were happy enough to be here however the lady suggested they'd be making a lot of noise behind us and would probably be bashing about around the seats as it appeared they'd used up the back row for their stuff and seating, we said this was OK initially but she continued to prompt us to move, we started to do so with us having to start moving and packing up our stuff, there wasn't much in the way of help on offer and we were made to feel like we were causing more of an inconvenience by booking ahead to get our seats, no suggestion of where were going was made initially which resulted in us moving without our stuff and in the end all the confusion and messing about just raised our stress levels. It appeared in the end that some of the cabin crew had taken up the seats around us and thankfully some of the crew, particularly one of the younger female crew members and another gentleman were very courteous and offered help with a clearly very upset passenger, the other more senior staff could do to perhaps follow their lead as their idea of customer service was far below expected. Aside from this, this particular plane had screens above rather than individual ones on the back of the seats, one film was offered, food was OK, same usual fare, I assume from the amount of chatter about drinks I heard that there was a shortage of certain drinks, particularly beer at one point. Generally, I'm disappointed as this is one of the longest and one of the most expensive flights I've been on. I've flown on the more notoriously bad budget airlines and still found that despite all the shortcomings at least the staff seem to care and they also seem to be a bit more apologetic about late flights, I don't think I'd use American Airlines again if there was another choice.";NEGATIVE

First a delay of two hours, then half an hour, then two minutes here, 10 minutes there and before you know it, the flight was delayed until 11 pm. This was extremely frustrating to be strung along for so long. At the very last second, the gate crew made an unintelligible announcement that our flight was being rerouted to LAX. This created chaos and provided only minutes for people to try and make arrangements at their final destinations before boarding and take off. Announcements were difficult to hear and brusquely delivered. On the plane, the crew was perfunctory and unhelpful. The reason for the rerouting was that the San Diego airport would be closed at midnight and we would not make it in time. I am sure the airline staff knew this and could have provided that information in a much more timely fashion than it did. Very disappointing to be treated with such disrespect, disregard and callousness. A bus was provided for the final leg to San Diego, making the trip a grueling all night, uncomfortable affair.

That was also disappointing because you had to pay both for the entertainment and the food. The inflight WiFi worked and offered three options: GoGo InFlight: Pay to browse the internet, check e-mails, etc. Prices like $4 for half an hour. Not bad.

When at long last I managed to reach the seating plan, the two last remaining economy seats I selected were no more and I was left with having to pay extra for the extra legroom seats. Upon boarding I was appalled by the aged aircraft and obsolete amenities. No individual screens, no plug-ins for phones, not even basic earphones provided unless you pay $5. Both featured movies were 2nd rate and displayed on some heavy CRT suspended units which emitted a very annoying glare during the red-eye flight. The extra legroom was not worthwhile or all that noticeable, as an equally crucial attribute was the lateral tightness of the seats which caused the usual shoulder-rubbing and sleeplessness. It was all-in-all was a strange throw-back to the 70s. For a flight of such duration, there was only one serving of drinks but even then, no snack of any sort. There were no pillows, but some left-over garbage from an earlier flight in the seat pocket. I arrived at baggage claim before others and there was a very long interlude for belt to start moving. Eventually after a prolonged and futile watch, my checked luggage was never forthcoming so I headed to their baggage service to report missing luggage. Luckily agent was helpful and wait wasn't long to write up the delayed baggage claim. However I was perturbed by the sheer number of displaced/delayed baggage affecting over hundred other passengers. An agent finally picked up my call after 35 minutes wait. Their online baggage status still has no update on my luggage where-about. Agent could not give any reason why, despite luggage was being checked over an hour and a half prior to flight departure.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-08-15;"Service was shocking. The flight from MIA-CUN was delayed due to a thunderstorm which grounded all aircrafts and closed the airport. American Airlines had informed passengers and since there was nothing which could be done, we waited in lounge for boarding to begin. Upon boarding aircraft, the FA's offered drinks and that's where the hospitality ended. After takeoff they came around once more with drinks, and packaged snacks. Afterwards, they stood in the gallery gossiping rather loudly and complaining about the airline (found it rather off putting). On the return leg, similar service. Loud FA's, packaged snacks and less than mediocre service. Older planes on both legs, but they were clean and seats were comfortable. Check-in in CUN was quick and efficient.";NEGATIVE

I was placed on a flight that was four hours later than my original flight. All other flights were full so I had to enjoy my six hour visit at the airport. My complaint is for this reason only, other airlines I fly give you email updates when a flight is delayed or cancelled. If American Airlines had taken this approach I could have possibly made another reservation or at least, hung out in my hotel for another four hours. Instead I had to hang out in an airport for six hours.";NEGATIVE

People don't realize that there are more than one flight attendant available to serve drinks and some snacks during flight, not just during their meal times. American's level of service is very standard for major carriers like Delta and United both domestically and internationally. I find that the majority of the time when I'm traveling it is passengers who do not understand air travel that are most frequently angry or upset. Those of us who travel frequently understand, those that don't have no idea. ";POSITIVE

It would've been ok if they were courteous and respectful but they were horrible. We arrived at Montego Bay at 3.55pm and didn't get to speak with anyone about our luggage until 6.15 pm because the person who was suppose to be at our counter (AA) was ""busy assisting someone else"" as they kept telling us. When we did speak with someone, they informed me that our luggage was still in Dallas but will arrive first thing in the morning. We were excited to hear that and continued on to our resort. First thing in the morning came and went, afternoon came and went, evening came and went. We had the hotel call the airport (we tried calling ourselves but the room phone wouldn't properly dial out the 800 number) they were told the luggage would be here soon. Our luggage came at 11 pm the second night we were there. Our vacation was only for 6 days, two days have already passed when we received it. No one knows why we didn't get it until and when the resort called they kept lying (AA representative) and said it was already on its way and would be here in two hours. We heard two hours for two days. Fast forward 8 days. We used AA once again for our trip to Aruba which was 8 days after this first disaster. When we go to check in (again first class/business class) the airline double booked us and had us flying to multiple locations. AA rep informed us we would have to check in at counter. We went to check in at the counter and it took us TWO hours, yes two hours to fix our reservations. I am traveling with my SO who is a disabled veteran (we both are veterans) who was told he had to stand those two hours because they didn't have a wheelchair available for him. It takes AA two hours to issue us tickets and then they change our flights making our stay in Aruba airport 4 hours. When I expressed how disappointed we were the AA rep informed me that this is the norm for AA. He said we shouldn't be complaining about only waiting two hours to get our tickets printed. He was rude along with the manager who kept talking in Spanish. We fly often, very often using American Airlines and we are embarrassed for you guys treating customers this way. ";NEGATIVE

Cabin was clean, seats are ok with IFE and legroom is spacious. Take off was smooth. To my horror we had to pay in order for us to watch a movie and even use the wifi.

Our flight back from JFK was delayed and when we eventually got on board the aeroplane was quite possibly the oldest plane I have been on with a cabin crew to match. After 10 minutes the pilot informed us that a member of American Airlines staff had attempted to open the cabin door when it had already been locked which resulted in the life raft falling off the plane!

However, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for all of our luggage to be deplaned. During this time three other planes landed, all of their luggage was sorted out and the passengers from those planes left the terminal. We found one of our pieces of luggage was still in Miami. Our flight came in at 3.30pm, originally supposed to land at 2.57pm. It is well know that ferries stop running from Charlotte Amalie at 4.30pm. American should have done everything in its power to get people on their way. At least one third of the passengers were in the same situation as us. Four others lost baggage.

The individual reverse herringbone seats on the 777 are second to none. Privacy and sleeping space are guaranteed. The entertainment is good enough and the flight crew professional and even friendly to some extent. The one downside was the food, which was not only below what one would expect for J and not very tasty either. In the transcon similar experience.

I was thinking this would be the worst part of our trip - but it wasn't. On the way home - our flight was delayed yet again. We flew out 2 hours after our original flight was scheduled, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. There were no later flights, so we had to stay overnight. When I asked them about a room, along with many other passengers, we were given a discounted rate at a hotel 15 miles from the airport.

So we ran to the next gate which took 30 minutes (Heathrow). When we got there my wife looked at the tickets and the layover was 4 hours. So why did the employee have us run? Because the flight was to Florence, not Pisa and they probably didn't want us to notice. So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place?

I feel like an airline should understand times and how each airport is and should not schedule flights if they know it will be almost impossible for their customers. We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo.

AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation.

Took an hour to remove, another hour to install and then testing began. After 2 hours of delay, given $12 meal voucher. You can't even buy a pre-made sandwich at ORD for that amount. Missed our connection and the rebooked one too. Trip that should have been 16 hours to my home took 24 hours. AA gave me 5000 air miles, which costs them nothing. ";NEGATIVE

After check-in, I was escorted to the front of the TSA Pre-Check Line and was done with security in two minutes, although I wish the agent was more jovial. Flagship Lounge great with plenty of breakfast options and an extensive beverage selection. The lounge was not crowded. Seating was comfortable and WiFi was fast. Overall, a great space with much better food and drinks than the regular lounge. Flight was good. Seats were spacious with tons of storage. Power ports, USB plugs, remote control and a bunch of other features located by your seat. Seat was private, minor complaint would be the firmness, wish there were a lot more soft like the ones they have on the Boeing 767-300s. TV screens were huge, great interactive map with plenty of entertainment options. The purser was interactive and friendly, although they lack some finesse. She dropped my appetizer on the floor and constantly spilled liquid on my tray table.  Food in abundance, they also introduced a new menu that I got to try out. Appetizer, main and dessert were all good quality, although nothing memorable. Salad was extremely disappointing. It tasted and looked like leftovers from a prepackaged bag of salad and the dressing was oily. Overall, food could have been better although for a flagship route, American should step up their game, considering Delta offers excellent inflight meals on shorter flights. All in all, the flight was great. Excellent ground service, good service, great seat, although food needs some improvement.";POSITIVE

However, let me emphasize on the poor baggage handling on this flight. We arrived at the Terminal, 4-5 hours before boarding time, just to be sure. We were allowed to check-in. However, upon arrival at our final destination (STL), our bags were not with the plane. They were not on any of our flights! As it turns out, our bags never left New York.  We thought that being very early for our flight guaranteed every detail to be fine, including our luggage. However this event was truly a disappointment.

On the return home, we missed our connecting flight in Charlotte because there was congestion on the runway. The next flight was not for three hours. Then that plane was late and needed repairs, so after seven hours in the airport, we finally got on a plane to fly the 45 minutes from Charlotte to Atlanta.

The aircraft was having ""maintenance"" issues which I learned only by calling the Platinum Desk. The plane was removed from the gate and taken back to the hangar. We were told we'd be boarding at 3.30 pm. And some of us - perhaps 10 - did board, only to be told to disembark. The pilot had ""timed out"" after waiting around all day like the rest of us. A few minutes before 4 pm, another pilot showed up and boarded the plane, but he strode off after a few minutes. The flight was then canceled altogether. I managed to secure a seat on a 6.17 pm flight to LAX via Chicago. In the meantime, I complained to a gate agent about the inadequate service and ""surly, ill-mannered, uncommunicative"" agents. The flight to Chicago eventually took off, and we connected from there to LAX, arriving at the California airport around 11.15 pm. My original itinerary had me arriving at 11.29 am.

I wasn't looking forward to the old B767 that we would fly either. But flight took off on time and wasn't that bad. I slept most of the time, partly due to a lack of personal entertainment. The only entertainment was an overhead screen showing some terrible movie. Crew was good, particularly one. Can't remember his name but you'll know when you meet him. Food was okay, main meal was decent, the ice-cream and snacks were excellent. Flight landed on time. So all in all a very average flight, but I won't recommend it.";NEGATIVE

The airport in Miami is huge and after the last gate change, we were told that our flight would leave in 30 min. The AA agent made one phone call for assistance and then left us to our own devices. We had to frantically scramble to find a golf cart, wheelchair, someone to assist. Many of the other passengers on the flight were outraged and not one AA representative gave us any reason why our flight kept getting postponed. Finally, when we boarded at 11.30, the pilot explained that extreme weather kept us from leaving on time. Not sure if I buy this explanation, as other flights departed, but at least he offered an explanation and an apology. Not even a packet of peanuts.

No apology, staff were unhelpful and counter staff downright ""offish"" to the situation. I was even told the mobile app doesn't communicate with flight counter so its information can be incorrect. So the question is what's the point of the app if doesn't provide up-to-date info. Flight booked for next day. So we incurred cost of overnight near JFK and incurred cost of night at destination. No offer to assist with accommodation for overnight caused by the cancellation. We were made to feel as if we as the customer was an intrusion to the non-operation of this flight. I lost my confidence with the airline, and return flight from Cancun to Dallas, the flight was delayed by almost three hours.

The little TV screen monitor that they had on the seat in front of me was tiny, and didn't have very many shows to watch. But, the staff were extremely friendly, and they had multiple drink options.

We then had to re-queue at check-in for over an hour and a half, staff were rude, brusque and aloof. Told that our only options were to cancel altogether or fly 9.5 hours later to Heathrow via British Airways. As we only had 3 nights in New York we would lose a third of our trip. We asked to come back a day later so we would actually get the trip that we had paid for, meaning adding on the day we lost onto the end of our holiday but they wouldn't honour this.

We bought tickets a month before our flight and ended up paying almost $700 each roundtrip (for 4 of us). On June 21st we drove 2 hours to Charlotte Airport and on our way we got an automated call telling us our flight had been cancelled for maintenance (at around 11.30) on a beautiful, clear day. Not knowing what to do we continued to the airport terminal and through the check-in line. The employee at the check-in said we had been rescheduled on a flight for the next day at 5.30am. This wasn't an acceptable alternative for us so we were put on standby for a 4.30 flight but then we had to check-in our stowaway luggage. We asked how we would get our luggage back if we didn't make it on the 4.30 flight, and were told that the luggage was marked for standby and would not be put on the plane without us. Past security we checked with other United Airways employees who assured us this was the case. These employees were all helpful and patient with us. We waited in the airport for hours for the standby flight, which unsurprisingly did not have space for all 4 of us. We were sent to baggage claim and waited for luggage that never showed up. Our bags had been sent to Toronto YYZ without us. I called Toronto Pearson airport where a helpful woman connected me to the United Airways baggage office. Finally I was satisfied that they probably weren't going to send our luggage back to Charlotte, and we drove up north. At Toronto Pearsons we found customer service who made a call and told us exactly where to find our luggage. A 1/10 rating is generous.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-07-01;I flew out from Pensacola on June 23rd at 4pm. What was supposed to be a connecting flight in North Carolina turned into a disaster. My flight kept getting delayed with minimal communication of when our flight would be taking off. The flight time continued to change and hours passed by with little communication as to why. The flight that was suppose to board at 9.40pm did not get cancelled until just before 2am. I had already been traveling for 14 hours. I waited in a ridiculously long line only to be told that the hotels in the area were all booked and that the cots at the airport were taken. I did not sleep at all. I had to re-route my original flight from LAX twice because one of the workers routed me to San Jose which was 6 hours away from my destination (LAX). They re-routed me again an hour out of the way at John Wayne airport and had to find someone else to pick me up because of the change of my arrival. When I arrived my checked bag was nowhere to be found. My bag arrived a few days later.

These things sometimes happen, but what followed was not acceptable. Customer service representatives had no solutions for anyone, other than bookings for the next flight 24 hours later. No hotel, transportation, nothing. My service at the desk was dismissive: we can't help. We have no solutions or contingencies. It was only after my pestering them, when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel. The biggest problem is that customer service failed spectacularly at the point where the client is most vulnerable and alone-in transit. There should be a representative for each imperiled connecting flight, or group of flights. On-ground coordinators should be communicating with gate agents and in-flight attendants. Even when connections are simply impossible, let us know and give us options, at the point of debarkation. All it takes is for someone to actively monitor and question the line. ";NEGATIVE

I was given no vouchers for food or anything else, was given minimal assistance, just a slip of paper and ""hope they have room for you on the next one"".

american-airlines;2015-06-17;"Throughout my recent trip, there were difficulties due to under-staffing at the terminals and ticket check-in, leading to several long delays. Several of us missed our first flight out of Gainesville since there was miscommunication leading to no one being at the check-out counter prior to our departure and none of the boarding pass kiosks working. The return flights were equally difficult, with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter, which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed, leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times, it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day, multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself, I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home. In summary, due to consistent under-staffing, there were numerous long waits which ultimately delayed travel planned. This combined with several flight delays (due to mechanical difficulties - not weather), lead do my initial flight leaving a day late and my return flight being delayed 2 additional days.

american-airlines;2015-06-15;"First trip on the reconfigured B777 business class and I was impressed. Virtually identical to the CX layout, which I love. Quite a bit of privacy and personal space, with a very comfortable flat bed. IFE had ample choices, and the food and beverage was good as well. In flight overseas WiFi worked very well also. Flagship check in at LHR in a separate and dedicated building makes the process very easy. I think AA has upped their game on the overseas routes - perhaps not all - but this was an excellent trip.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-15;"First overseas trip in the newly configured B767 with flat beds. The cabin looks very crisp, clean, and modern but I found the seats to be uncomfortable and poorly designed. The seats seem very narrow, and once in the flat bed position your feet end up in a narrow, confining box-like area which makes it difficult to move around. Impacted sleep quality immensely. Tablet-based IFE strange, clunky with limited choices. The biggest positive surprise was the food, which was as good an airline meal as I've had. Perfectly roasted duck breast in a coconut lime curry was restaurant quality, salads fresh and crisp. On balance better than expected and an improvement for AA.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-14;"AA has completely lost my trust. The woman at the check in counter knew nothing about free bags for military civilians. After paying for our bag, she gave us our boarding pass and mentioned nothing about it being delayed. We found out after I noticed that the time was different on our boarding pass. When the time came to board, we find out that the flight is cancelled when we noticed no plane at our gate. We approached some AA attendants and the woman apologized for forgetting to announce it, and then looked for another flight for us. She found one for a 5am flight - 4.30am check in and gave us a hotel voucher of which the shuttle runs every half hour. That means we would have to leave the hotel at 3am in order to make the flight. At 2.30am, my boyfriend finds out through the flight tracker to discover it is cancelled again! He tries to call customer service to reschedule but had a 1 hour wait time on the phone. When he finally gets through, the man on the phone suggested a flight at JFK at 7am, which we wouldn't be able to make it in time even if we left at that moment (3.40) because we would have to wait for the (every 30 min) shuttle, get on the airport train, get to the stop for long term parking, then get the bus to get us to our car, and then drive over an hour to JFK. So then he puts us on a 3.50 flight to Chicago getting us there at nearly 6pm. Our whole Saturday is gone. AA wasted us a lot of money and time. I will never fly with them again. ";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-13;"What has happened? Airlines have revolved into greedy money making machines and in turn allowed people to become smug and uncaring for others. What used to happen in my day when a person of 6ft 5ins boarded a plane there was consideration and care? Now it is all about extra money! I distinctly remember when this situation arose we would kindly ask smaller exit seated passengers to swap and 9 times out of ten people would be happy to do so. We maybe would offer a few drinks in return and everyone was happy. My son who is 6ft 5in was like a caged animal on our recent American Airlines flight, 10 hours of absolute hell. Yes we could have paid more for an exit seat but he is a student and this was not an option. While shorter passengers get seats for less he is now faced with either having to pay more to travel than shorter people or not travel at all. It is not as if he can do anything about his height, if he was simply overweight – then he could diet – but this is not the case. American Airlines allowed him to stand up all the way from LA to LHR for 10 hours, when he had to sit his legs had to be wide apart and any chance of a brace position would be completely ruled out. American Airlines – shame on you for your greed! I am not sure why trolleys were used for the meal service – they could have just chucked boxes of junk down the cabin and asked those interested to catch them. ";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-13;"I flew non-stop from SLC to MIA on a redeye, 4 hours of flight time, no problems, delighted to find a non-stop flight. A week later, coming home, (June 10 2015) was a totally different experience.  The flight to DFW was delayed for a mechanical problem (air speed indicator), so they re-boarded us on a different plane, but after all passengers were seated and the safety video shown, they said there was another mechanical problem (didn't identify it) and sent all 200 of us to a re-booking desk which couldn't possibly accommodate all of us.  Meanwhile after an hour standing in line, they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight, toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407, but by now it was 5.30 pm, with no signs of hope. I knew I'd already missed my connecting flight to SLC, and was able to book another DFW flight for 6 pm.  I made it in time to board this different flight, but the 6.00 departure time turned out to be 7.00pm.  The delay here was for yet another unexplained reason.  Still,  I was able at DFW to make my connecting flight to SLC on a 10.00 flight, but this interminable day stretched out far longer than it should have, and I don't see how it could be, that every single AA flight I was on that day, all had delays. The staff were friendly and helpful, but, I can't recommend this airline. ";NEGATIVE

Check in was actually surprisingly smooth and efficient, friendly staff. Out of the 12 Cabin Crew on the 3 legs 9 didn't spare a smile, didn't manage to finish the 'service' (consisting of 1 complimentary drink) and seemed to be tired and/or just hated their job. 2 were plain rude to fellow passengers for no apparent reason as well as unprofessional and only 1 of the 12 was outstandingly nice and cheery as well as professional.

I will never fly with this airline again. I am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of service and the delays they have for every flight.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-11;"Just returned from a trip to the Caymans for a wedding, and as usual had a bad experience on American.  I had hoped that the pending merger would improve Americans quality, but instead I'm afraid it will make USAir worse.  I used miles and flew business class on USAir - cost 120,000!  The plane was actually an American plane, and was dirty, with torn, worn out, uncomfortable seats. Service was marginal.  I keep having bad experiences on American, and have actually decided to use up my miles and change to another carrier - it is sad to see how airline travel has degraded - dirty, worn out, cramped, buses with wings.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-06;I travelled to and back from LGA. Going was actually with US Airways. The staff on both journeys were rude although the LGA to LHR flights were better. Going to LGA staff were rude and not helpful when serving food. The entertainment system was okay although have seen better the touch screens do not work properly. I was sat at the front so luckily had good space however the other seats seemed tight. The second part of the flight (domestic one) was a two by two carrier and the tiniest aircraft I had seen. I would not recommend and I would avoid at all costs.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-06;My husband and I flew to London in business class on 4/29/2015. Plane was old business class seats were too close to each other the food was the worst ever. Toilets were dirty. We will never fly American Airlines business class anymore. Very unsatisfied customers. We usually fly Qantas business to the U.S. from Australia and let me tell you that it is a first class airline! I'm flying back to London on July 9 business class flying with BA never again AA. Very dissatisfied customers.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-06;American Airlines without notification or reason cancelled my ticket on the return leg of my trip leaving me stranded. The flight to Seattle from Philadelphia went smoothly. I was able to check in board and fly without problem and it was actually one of my most pleasant flights. However when I tried to check in for the return flight I was informed that my ticket had been cancelled. After waiting on hold for a long time one of the American Airlines representatives informed me that the ticket was cancelled because I never boarded the plane in Philadelphia. Eventually I was told that if I showed my boarding pass from the flight from Philadelphia to Seattle to a check-in representative they would be able to book a seat on the flight for me. However until that time the seat was not reserved for me or guaranteed in any way. It was important that I make the flight in order to be at work so I had to make an extra trip to the airport early so I could re-book my ticket thereby wasting precious vacation time. So do not fly on American Airlines unless you enjoy the thrill of not knowing if you'll get to use the ticket you bought the mystery of whether the airline knows you're on the plane or not and the excitement of using vacation time to pick your way through a companies complex inaccessible and unable customer service system.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-06-04;First Class JFK - Seattle June 1. Although the flight was delayed almost two hours due to a combination of weather aircraft delays etc.. the flight was fine. The JFK ground crew worked with a combination of humor and professionalism that provided the right touch at the gate and once the aircraft arrived everyone worked very quickly to get us on our way. Once in flight we had warm service in the small front cabin (737-800) by two experienced yet friendly attendants. The food was definitely an upgrade from recent trips and all in all I felt American did a good job. Baggage delivery at Sea-Tac was awful.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-31;May 14th AA63. May 21st AA62. Paris-Miami Economy: the worst experience I have had for a long distance flight. I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn. I have tried many other airlines for long distance flights being in Europe or Asia and none of them were as bad as this one.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-31;"Flew with my wife from Seattle to Charleston with stops in DFW and DCA. Selected the least expensive flights and we are not frequent travelers so I did not expect a great experience. Our flights did get rescheduled probably due to the merger with US Airways. Delays were manageable with just one hour on the first leg out of Seattle. What I did not expect was for the flight attendants to be so curt and rude. When I was denied a blanket I could almost read the attendants mind (""please put me out of my misery""). Impolite doesn't even begin to describe their attitude.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-31;"A very frustrating experience. First their flight is delayed due to ""bad weather"" in LGA whereas we can see that United and all other airlines are taking off and the weather looked good enough. Initially they said it is delayed by an hour so we thought fine lets wait for an hour then they tell its delayed by another 2 hours. We had to catch a connecting flight at ORD which had just an hour layover. Then finally this flight from LGA is scheduled to take off 6 hours later than actual scheduled timings which means the connecting flight has already left. I called the customer care to check for the status and they tell that there are no more connecting flights from ORD to XNA for the day. The next connecting flight was only at 9.15am from ORD. So we decided to wait until 6.30am that day and leave directly from LGA instead of going to ORD and waiting till 9.15am. We (including my aged mother) finally landed up sleeping in the airport all night. The TSA officials were kind enough to give all passengers sleeping in the airport a cot and a bed sheet. Next day morning we start at 6.15AM and then again the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. One of the passengers asked the flight attendant if she will get her connecting flight and the attendant replies ""We just have to keep hopes. That is all we can do""!";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-29;I flew from IAH Airport to DFW as a layover and then DFW to ORD as the final destination on Saturday May 23rd. The flight leaving IAH was on time and arrived on time to DFW. However the flight from DFW was delayed by 45 minutes because the plane was coming in from Montego Bay Jamaica. So we had to wait and it took an additional hour to arrive at final destination.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-28;All four flights were terrible and the disorganization and poor customer service was inexcusable. We didn't experience anything like mixed up flights or delays that lasted too long but what we did experience was bad enough. We left for an international flight that departed at 6am they had such slow kiosk and desk service that almost an entire flight of people barely made it on the plane. Kiosks weren't working the people that worked there didn't even know what was going on and were flustered. The anxiety level was high because we all thought we might miss our flight due to American Airlines awful check in service. Instead of reassuring people that the flight wasn't going to leave without 75% of it's passengers. The wifi isn't free it doesn't work half the time and they boast 'free' things to watch and it's all a scam. For as much as they charge for a flight something as little as wifi can make a huge difference. We were on an international flight and they don't even offer snacks you have to buy snacks! I had a bad cold coming home and asked the flight attendant for some cold water and hot water and tea. She rolled her eyes at me and brought me hot water and cold water and no tea. I had to ask for tea from another flight attendant who practically threw it at me. I went to the bathroom during the flight and asked a flight attendant for tissues (again I had a bad cold) she was sitting down looking at her phone and didn't even look up at me just pointed at the bathroom. On the flight home there was a group of people that were obviously traveling together and were so disruptive and rude. They were standing up in the aisle talking loudly and there was a toddler with them that kept running up and down the aisle. The flight attendants never once controlled the situation even though all the other passengers were clearly annoyed and people were saying so out loud.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-27;Flew May 9 2015 from Boston to Paris. I am 75 yrs old and having lived both in South Africa and Europe have done a considerable amount of flying. This flight was absolutely the worst ever. Conditions regarding space and comfort (lack thereof) were beyond appalling. People who could not fit their feet under the seat in front of them were forced to stick them into the aisle. I feel that safety is compromised by these conditions and both the US Transportation Department and American Airlines need to seriously consider this issue. I will of course never fly with this airline again. In addition the food was not fit for consumption.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-25;I flew from Orlando to Barcelona on May 6th with a return on May 18th. It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day. In terms of choosing an airline carrier it is sadly my opinion that airlines such as KLM or Lufthansa offer better service and would be my first choices on international flights.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-20;ORD-SAT on Apr 9 and RNO-ORD on Apr 23 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Both flights fine with slightly early arrivals and no drama - Obviously older planes showing some wear and tear but comfortable with standard First class seats. FA tending to First Class on the ORD-SAT leg was excellent hard working attentive continuously present in the cabin to tend to the passengers also a bit more formal (in a good way) less chatty (again good) and obviously concentrating on delivering a good service. FA on the second leg more relaxed in delivering service but still ok. Catering for the first (evening) leg was a chicken or pasta choice with the chicken dish bland and just barely edible. Not good enough even for economy on many other airlines. Also strange that AA considers the chicken or pasta choice a First Class offering on a three hour dinner time flight probably only possible on the US market. Wines served were ok and regular refills offered by the good FA. First Class breakfast RNO-ORD leg was cereal with no other option. Again how this can be considered a First Class breakfast for a four hour flight is beyond me. Good premium check-in with no significant lines and manned counters in both ORD and RNO boarding professional and painless. Actually two pleasant flights with good crews but also with sub- par catering. Also of course excellent value due to the upgrade.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-20;Flight 55 to Chicago due out Sunday morning at 9.30. Sat in airport all day to find out at around 3pm that the flight had been cancelled due to a technical issue. No information from the staff all day. Had to find out what was going on via the website. The flight got rescheduled for Monday. After another hour delay we finally boarded the same aircraft that they where having issues with the previous day. We set off to the runway only to turn back with a technical issue. We were then sat onboard the aircraft for a further 6 hours as they where having the same issues as the previous day. After the 6 hours we where informed that the flight was being cancelled yet again. By this time it was to late to make alternative arrangements. The downfall for me was the job I should have been at on Monday morning had to be cancelled as I could only get there by Wednesday. Total disgrace.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-20;I had a flight from Chicago to London Heathrow. Flight 46 on 14th May. A Boeing 767-300. Delayed by 2 hours so missed my British Airways connection. Cabin was dull. Worst part no personal screen and seats short on legroom. Felt like all economy passengers were refugees running to some other place. Food was ok but not as good as compared to Air India. Staff were ok too. Will never recommend AA.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-20;After a 24 hour delay during which time we were not kept informed of what was happening we board another plane. The new plane sits on the tarmac 45 minutes past take off time and only then the pilot informs us there appears to be a problem with the plane so the plane returns to the gate. There are no apologies there is no information and it seems total indifference to people like myself who will miss their connection resulting in a further 8 hour delay. Service is zero professionalism is zero however the aircrew do appear to be putting in a lot of effort to avoid passing among the passengers or making eye contact. Flight 9268 to Chicago.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-18;I flew Baltimore to Seoul (BWI-DFW-ICN) on 10 May 2015 the flight out of Baltimore had to return to the gate due a cockpit display not working making the flight an hour late on take off. We were then diverted due to weather - admittedly the crew were helpful during our enforced 4 hour plane-bound ground stop in Austin. We finally got to Dallas 5 hours late – ‘to be greeted by a (non-existent) customer representative’ the queue for the customer service at C25 was pathetic – two people and a queue of several hundred snaking around the terminal. Fortunately I had my BA executive card and got into the Admirals lounge were the queue was only about 20 people. We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical ‘issues’ meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual ‘packages’ for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky – even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was ‘better’ – in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped – the 777 clearly had not been ‘spring cleaned’ since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the ‘entertainment system’ simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to. Quite simply AA (as do other US carriers) provided the absolute bare minimum. Unfortunately it is ‘company policy’ to only fly American carriers – and probably the only reason that American carriers still exist.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-13;Flight 2256 to depart IAH at 6pm on 5/12/15 was delayed by one hour. Myself and 2 daughters were on our way to Branson MO for a short vacation with family. This delay made it impossible to connect to our flight at DFW so we had to reschedule our flights to the next day cutting into our planned time with family. I have not flown AA in years due to lost luggage issues previously and this is my experience the first time I tried to use them again. Not only was this a huge hassle with 2 kids to get to and thru the airport (then out again and back the next day) but I'm very disappointed in the fact that our vacation is having to be cut into as a result of the flight delay. Extremely disappointed.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-11;AA138 DFW-DCA first class. I've really stopped expecting anything when flying domestically in the US or Canada. Flight departed late due to heavy traffic and weather. Seat ok but nothing special on a 737-800. Was in 1A. Having just got off QR from Doha a big change. Cabin crew not friendly Basically had my meal tossed at me. Meal itself was tasteless and over cooked. No control over economy class passengers using first class lavatory even while the seatbelt sign was on. It is getting me home which is about all I can say that is positive about this flight.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-11;It is not a good feeling when you get ashamed of the company that is representing your country to the world. But it was how I felt when I boarded AA 91 from London to Chicago. The oldest plane ever out of 4 overhead TV (they didn't even fold-this ancient) 2 didn't work. How can you still not have an in seat entertainment on an 8 hours international flight? Noise level in the cabin was at times unbearable. It was the last leg of our round-trip to Greece. First 3 legs were served by British Airways - what a dramatic difference.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-10;AA2320 - May 7 2015. Inaugural 787 flight on AA - DFW to ORD. Fun flight - a lot of press at the boarding area. Photos were taken of each passenger standing in front of a green screen so that you would get a picture printed with you in front of the plane. 82 people on the upgrade list for a completely full flight - most I've ever seen. Boarding was smooth - about 90% of the passengers were airline/aviation enthusiasts that purposely were on the flight. Flight attendants/pilots were all jovial and happy to show off the new plane. Water-cannon send-off from Terminal D - then a nice smooth take-off with cheers from passengers. Good inflight entertainment - but still they show the same shows that were on flights I took 9 months ago. Why can't American keep updated entertainment? Emirates/Singapore/Qantas/British all do it. Drink and BOB on board - people walking all over the plane between First and Coach taking pictures. Camera-men filming the cabins and passengers reactions. Landed early at ORD and quick disembarkation. Overall a good flight and cheap fare.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-10;"Just returned from a two week trip to China using AA into Beijing returning from Shanghai. We've traveled to over 70 countries world wide and this was the first and last time we'll ever use American Airlines. They use a 777-200 out of Chicago which resembles a cattle car the way passengers are packed into the economy section. 2-5-2 configuration and while we paid extra to sit in the two side the seats were so cramped there wasn't enough room between rows to put the tray table down for meals. When the passengers in front reclined their seats it was claustrophobic. Keep in mind this is a 14 hour flight. Ironically enough the flight attendants who refer to this equipment as the Slave Ship told us AA is talking about adding another row of seats. Meals were horrid power port and audio jacks didn't work and the ""entertainment"" system is laughable. We had three flights in China on China Eastern Airlines while we were there and their aircraft were all modern clean and spacious. If this is what we can expect from the American/US Airways merger I will avoid the new company at all costs.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-08;This was the worst travelling experience! The staff are rude and abrupt at check-in the meals are terrible and you cannot purchase anything else on board they didn't have earphones or the option to purchase on board (for a long haul flight from Philadelphia to Dublin) and none of the reading lights worked in our row. Aside from this the planes are extremely old to the point where it was genuinely terrifying. The insulation is extremely thin in comparison to other planes so you can hear every noise the engine makes! Also the navigation system didn't work as we were landing but the pilot told us not to worry he knew Dublin so he could find the airport!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-08;I just traveled with my mother to Miami Florida from Calgary Alberta in April we bought our tickets online a month before our trip. We received the flight information by email everything was going fine. The flight down to Miami was great however the return trip was a different story again we checked-in the night before to save time but they overbooked the flight from Dallas to Phoenix and my elderly mother had to pay an extra 35 dollars to be guaranteed a seat on the flight to be able to stay traveling with me. I was asked to check in my carry on in Dallas because they were not going to have enough space in the overhead compartments. When we arrived in Phoenix they announced that the flight was overbooked and asked if anyone was interested in staying overnight and catch the morning flight to Calgary they offered to pay for the hotel and give you a travel voucher I could not take them up on the offer as I had already checked my carry on in Dallas. We bought our tickets a month before I felt that our seats should be guaranteed. The only saving grace of the trip was that the stewards were very nice on the flights.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-04;"As two couples we traveled Heathrow to Palm Springs via Dallas Fort Worth. The Heathrow flight was on time and the service was ok but not great. A little too ""matter of fact"" if I can use that term. Our flight from DFW was a different affair. Because we couldn't book our seats we were advised to ask at the desk at Dallas. When we arrived I was impressed that they knew we were coming but added"" we think we have four seats spare but leave it with us"". I had already had trouble booking seats from Heathrow with not wanting to pay and extra £30 pre booking fee! We eventually did get 4 seats. 2 at the front and two at the back. The attendants were efficient although abrupt. On our return flight again we couldn't book the seats we wanted and got split up yet again on DFW to Heathrow leg. The Staff were quite rude to all passengers. One fellow passenger asked what choice was for breakfast? ""Only one option"" was the reply ""take it or leave it""! We got the impression that they didn't really want to be there. Many reading lights and video screens were not working just what you need on an overnight transatlantic trip! We bought our tickets in September 2014 and we couldn't get seats together when it came to the 24 hr check-in. So what gives. I will say this now. we wont fly AA again and I will not recommend them either. They are advertising ""We are Adding new planes every week"" I think they should repair some of their existing ones first!";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-02;Very happy to write a quick follow up to my recent review indicating that my good experience was not a fluke. LA- Kona first class on a 757. I was served a decent meal by an extremely pleasant crew including the signature sundae. Everything was crisp and professional with a touch of warm. Same comments about sad entertainment system though.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-05-01;Just travelled Heathrow - JFK and back in economy. Really happy with the service the stewards were very helpful even giving us info on the best places to eat in New York. The flight was half empty so we could spread out on both flights. It was on time. Food ok and they make sure we had a drink in our hand whenever we wanted. Very comprehensive choice of old and new films/TV. Would recommend.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-30;I am quite happy to write a positive review of my experience yesterday. Flying from Honolulu to LA on a 757 I was expecting very little. Instead I was welcomed by a warm crew to a comfortable seat and received warm attentive service. The breakfast was quite nice and beverages were free flowing and offered in a friendly manner. The entertainment on a screen ahead was minimal and that was the only second rate part of the trip. The pillow and blanket offered were large and comfy. I hope this signals an upgrade system-wide for a product that has long called for one.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-28;"Will not be flying with this airline again. Was traveling from Seattle to Houston Hobby through DFW. Plane was delayed on the runway for over an hour because American couldn't communicate with their own computer system in Dallas. Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag. Then after I was seated they called me off the airplane saying they had double booked my seat! They could not return my bag to me. Put me on yet another flight to Houston for two hours later. But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left. Everyone on that flight was moved to my new flight. Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate. Then we were told the ramp was closed so there was no gate for us to refuel at so we had to just wait. Finally a gate opened up for us but we just sat there for another hour. Then the captain told us that he reached his maximum number of flying hours so the flight was cancelled. At this point I cut my losses rented a car and drove to Houston from Dallas.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-28;This review is being written after a number of times flying with American Airlines. You can almost always expect delays terrible customer service and just an overall bad experience. We had a two hour delay from MIA to SFO which would connect to LAX. The airline representatives were not helpful and made our travel anxiety even worse. Absolutely the worst airline across the board-from aircraft to personnel. How could the customer service be so terrible? The only reason I chose this airline was because it was cheaper than JetBlue. American Airlines is truly a disappointment.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-27;A321 TPA-IA 737 MIA-YYZ. First leg delayed by over 1.5 hrs. Missed connection by 12 minutes. No apologies and stupid explanations. Put us on flight over 5 hours later. Once boarded we sat over an hour waiting for a pilot! Two different stories. Pilot delayed in traffic or pilot was timed out for his duty day and had to find someone else to drive the 737. And of course they lost our luggage. Is this any way for a major airline to operate?;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-27;We had two flights with AA from Madrid to Miami with their 777. The first flight was five hours late no excuse no money. The B777 is one of the worst you can fly with - 2-5-2 seating but AA charges 100 Euro extra for the 2 seats-row. The seating is horrible no space in economy the in-flight entertainment is like 2002 with a small amount of films on re-run every 15 or 30 minutes (by the way my LCD did not work). The worst about AA is the staff - unfriendly tired and virtually throwing the trash food on your seat. Even for a US-carrier AA is under all poor standards. So - stay away. American is like Ryanair but not as cheap. Never again!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-24;DCA-DFW-SEA-DFW-IAD B737-800 Coach Class for all four segments 04/17 and 04/21. PROS: First Class check-in due to my One World Emerald Tier status. Flights on time except for DFW-SEA that left the gate on time but returned due to a mechanical problem that resulted in a delayed departure of an hour and arrival in SEA 40 minutes late. All planes clean and either new or fairly new. Staff efficient and most were quite friendly except for one on the SEA-DFW segment who had an attitude problem. Snacks for sale on three of the four segments and complimentary beverages served on all segments seats comfortable except for DCA-DFW (see CONS). Baggage transferred efficiently and delivered on the carousels at SEA and IAD very quickly as they had One World priority tags. CONS: The Admiral's Club Lounges look nice with comfortable seats but the free snack offerings at DFW were pitiful DCA-DFW had a brand new plane with the new B737 sky interior and AA leather seats. This was outstanding though sadly ruined by two awful boxes for the seat back video screens anchored on both sides of the middle seat foot well. This was pathetic for legroom on even a three-hour flight. Any airline that can find a very compact version of this video control box is a winner! Overall despite the many negative reviews that I have read recently about AA I was very satisfied with this trip and will definitely use them again. I didn't have high expectations for domestic AA service upon arrival at DCA on 04/17 but they actually did much better on the entire round-trip.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-24;R/T SFO-JFK. Outbound in business return in F. I think AA is doing a very good job with its Airbus 321 transcons in the premium classes. The seats are excellent both in C and in F. Indeed both are horiz lie flats. IFE is superb. Lots of choices large HD screens and Bose noise cancelling headphones supplied. Service was good in both directions. The food was a 7 on a scale of 10. My main criticism was the lunch in F. It unfortunately conveyed a sense of cut backs. Lounges at both ends were top notch particularly the F lounge at JFK. That is not to say that SFO Admirals was bad. It is truly excellent just that the F lounge is better. Overall on these transcons AA has a quality product.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-23;"Wife and I booked a trip from Houston to see the son in West Palm Beach on 4/17/2015. Our flight was supposed to be one of the first that left that day so we were ate the airport very early. Check in was 4 am. Of all the flights in the entire airport ours was delayed 2 hours. Why? Because they said it did not get in till late the previous day. Well that delay messed up our connecting flight in Dallas-Fort Worth so the day got worse and our total day was extended 6-7 hours. I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again. The money you save does not justify the agony or grief this airline dishes out.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-23;I was scheduled to fly from DFW to HOU Flight 5770 departing DFW 3.10pm arriving in HOU. Instead they notified us that there was no plane. We didn't have a plane to board until 5.30pm and the plane didn't depart until 6.20pm that evening. Over a 3 hour delay due to not having an available plane. Before we took off the pilot notified us that due to weather they were going to have to take a more Western route and were not sure if they were going to have enough fuel. Instead of actually getting more fuel we took off anyway. 30 min into the flight they notified us that there was a line to land into HOU due to weather and that they didn't have enough fuel and needed to land in San Antonio. Not only did we not get into SA until 8pm but the crew notified us that they had flown too many hours. So even if we did get more fuel there was no crew to fly the plane. At this point we were stranded in San Antonio and the weather had become so bad in Houston there were no planes out. We were stranded. After 2 hrs waiting in line the representative informed me I could not get back to Hobby until 7.30pm Monday. Monday I flew back to DFW 1433 to catch another plane 1489 to get to IAH by 12 noon. I took a cab from IAH to Hobby where my car was at b/c this was a better option than waiting all day to get back home. Practically over 24 hours to fly from DFW to HOU. I am extremely dissatisfied with American that I will no longer be flying this airline. Even though American did supply meal vouchers and put us in a hotel this is completely unacceptable.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-23;I know American is now responsible for US Air so I will put my comments here. I had a 4 leg trip from Houston to Ashville through Charlotte. Tickets were cheaper flying out of Bush but I will go through Hobby next time. Every leg of trip was delayed crowded or a rough ride. Seats were cramped. Snacks were to expensive. I checked my small bag to avoid the storage bin struggle. Our gate at Charlotte was doubled up for two flights from two major airports the information on screens was not updated with delays and confusing. I will pay more and fly another airline or drive before I fly American (US Air).;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-22;My family and I were traveling on March 27 on flight AA 238 from (DCA) Washington Ronald Reagan National D.C. at 5.35 pm to (MIA) Miami International Airport. The airplane was old. We could see where the paint was chipped on the right wing. We had seats 15D 15E and 15F. The seat next to the window would not move back up after it was inclined back. We were landing and we pressed the button and could not get the seat to move back in an upright position. A male flight attention called my attention and I said I could not move it. He said that seats on American were more aesthetic than they are functional. The airplane lacked tray tables. Accordingly when served drinks there was no place to put the drinks. Furthermore not only were tray tables absent from this old plane but even the lock to hold them in place was gone from the plane. The plane had not been properly cleaned before the flight and our flight was overbooked. The seats were very narrow even though we paid for more better seats. My mother who is of normal weight and body proportions had difficulty getting in and out of it. Our earlier trip to Washington DC from Miami was on a newer plane and we didn't have these problems.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-20;8th April AA57. Return on AA56. This was our first and last trip with AA. We were told we would be flying on the new AA planes. This simply was not true. Why should one pay the same price if you are going to fly on a dirty broken old plane in business with a ridiculous 2 3 2 seating arrangement and the entertainment system broken. We will never fly AA again. They seriously need to up their game to compete with Emirates Singapore etc.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-20;"This is a rough review because we flew first business and coach. We usually fly coach but for a trip to Napa we used our points to go first class. The AA/United merger combined the worst two airlines in the Western world. Flew on 4/7 (260 / 193) - BAN-DFX-SAN. Service food seating excellent. Plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight. Returned 4/13 (193/5290) SAN-Charlotte-BNA. Although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board. The trouble is the age of the planes - it's like something from a museum. The noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car. But for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems. We were closer to the real world of 95% of all travelers with tasteless food (a box handed out at the end of a 6 hour flight with a roll candy bar and smoothy). Entertainment (quote unquote) was from attached dirty ancient screens for which AA would kindly sell earphones. I had my IPAD and kept busy while the Mrs tried to doze. Then at Charlotte it's Reality Time. We got bumped to economy (first row) but the constant groans reminded us that these ""seats"" were once used for unruly reform school students. That was in the 1940's since they were tiny dirty torn and stretched. The place looked filthy. A webbed shower curtain in several pieces separated ""first class"" (real classy) but they did manage to pass drinks to us in the cattle car. Yes we are switching carriers to anyone who has bought a plane in the last 30 years.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-20;AA flight 2891 on 19th Apr 2015. Flight was late 140 mins due to which I was sure to miss my next connection to Calgary. Technical faults do occur and are understandable. But the issue is how rude and uncooperative the staff were. They had a permanent no for an answer for everything in a most unprofessional way. As a last resort I was booked on same day from San Francisco to Calgary as it was very important for me to be there in Calgary. I had to rush and take ground transportation from Sacramento to San Francisco and working out the next step as I was moving ahead. Forget help no guidance was provided on how I can get to SF airport. Would have accepted same sequence of events if they were delivered to me with a smile. AA staff needs serious training in this aspect of customer service.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-19;AA 954 on 12th April 2015. Truly awful service from Buenos Aires to NYC. Flight staff were alternately incompetent angry or non-existent. Bizarre lack of professionalism creates a stressful flight atmosphere. With so many international options never again will we fly American. Not worth the few dollars saved on the ticket price.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-19;"On April 9 2015 while my wife and I waited to board a flight from Barcelona to NY-JFK there was an announcement that it had been canceled. It was hard to hear and broadcast only once. Several of us had to confirm with an attendant that it was indeed canceled that we had to pick up our luggage at the baggage area and return to the check-in counter. My wife and I along with the others scrambled to navigate our way through the airport area finally to the baggage area. After what seemed like a very long wait our luggage along with a handful of others' came out last. This meant that when we finally found our way back to the AA check-in area we were at the end of an extremely long line. Eventually my wife and I ""split"" with her waiting on a long line at an AA service counter. After about 3 hours she made it to the front while I still had many people ahead of me. AA booked us on Iberia flights for the following day and a hotel with paid meals. We were then given directions to a free hotel shuttle. We never found it and ended up paying for a taxi but the driver took us to the ""wrong"" airport hotel. Fortunately that hotel let us take their shuttle to the ""right"" hotel. It's surprising but almost understandable that AA had no ""backup airplane"". My complaint is less about the cancellation and more about the lack of assistance at Barcelona Airport. Announcements and guidance was poor. There was no one to help us navigate back to the baggage area. We had to wait on a customs line to get back ""in"" so that we could go to the baggage area. We and others had to grab AA personnel passing by to find out anything even in the baggage area. It was an upsetting experience that cost us a day. We will think twice before using AA again & have spread the word wherever we can.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-19;LHR-RDU economy. I was really impressed with this flight. Ok the plane was the same age as me (28 I checked) and showed it - particularly in not having PTVs for quite a long flight. Seats a little hard. Everything else was very impressive though - food was edible and generous (main meal Ice cream and second snack meal) and regular drinks runs including beer. Staff were incredibly polite and friendly and there was a very relaxed atmosphere which I liked.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-17;My husband and our teenage son went to visit family in Nashville for two weeks this Easter. We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible. I made a point that we paid tickets for the flight that just left and had we managed to be on it we would not be asking for anything. We were told that we cannot collect our luggage as 'it has gone to BA'. We were given vouchers for an airport hotel and forced to stay overnight without luggage and they reluctantly gave us two sets of very basic things such as toothbrush and toothpaste for us three. The next day at AA check in desk we were told we need to collect our luggage at luggage collection No 5 after which we needed to bring it back upstairs and check them in. They could not locate our luggage. As the time for our next flight was approaching my husband ran to the check in desk to let them know that our luggage never materialised whilst I waited at carrousel No 5 in case it does. We asked if we could be upgraded if there were any spare seats in the premier class and the staff member said 'we do not upgrade for such a reason'. No other option would make me use this airline again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-16;"Non-existent customer service. Recently flew JAN-DFW-ELP. Delayed and missed connection in DFW due to weather. Had to overnight. No help whatsoever from AA because of ""weather"". No vouchers no distressed travel rates no phone number to call for booking my own hotel and had to walk 20 gates for hilariously cheap toiletries kit that was given grudgingly. Surly agents throughout. Truly an example of the worst in airline culture. To top it all off was unable to be booked on next morning flight and missed work. Agent could only put me on a later flight. Said I was put on FC upgrade list however. The next day when I was told I was upgraded they wanted $70 for the 1 hr flight. Agent said ""well it's not free"". I am AAdvantage Gold which is meaningless. Now a hostage to them with my new location but will take United or Southwest whenever possible in the future. People understand weather issues but the total lack of even the most basic customer service and rude behavior/attitudes is appalling about this ""airline"". Previously flown with Delta extensively and they always handled weather delays and misconnections in ATL professionally and courteously. So it can be done AA just doesn't care.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-14;Original flight was scheduled to depart at 10.30 am from DFW. Flight delayed too many times to count. Right now we are at 4 hours past (2.30 pm) I am on the plane have been sitting here with no air flow or electricity for about an hour. We were told that the flight crew was coming from OK however all the passengers from OK are on board and the flight attendants said they could not find pilots. This type of incompetence and lack of communication does not instil a lot of confidence in my safe arrival at my final destination. Although AA was $100 cheaper than United I will never fly with AA again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-12;Flew American three times in the past two weeks. All domestic. 1) San Francisco to O'Hare Chicago. 2) LaGuardia NYC to O'Hare Chicago. 3) O'Hare Chicago to San Francisco. Good: on time performance. Did not experience delays Bad: 25$ for a checked luggage? Come on! What are you? A Low Cost Carrier? And because of this many people opted for a carryon resulting in overcrowding of overhead bins. There were simply not enough space for all carry-ons. Bad: flight attendants! No smiles! Not very attentive. They looked tired grumpy and stressed! Bad: IFE! No individual screens. Bad: old single aisle Boeing planes. Bad: you have to pay for everything. Complimentary drinks limited to water canned sodas and juices.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-12;LHR-MIA March/April. We were sold this round trip on the 'new' AA Business Class product. We knew it was a 777-300ER LHR-MIA and a 777-300 back. The outbound was fantastic with great service seats AVOD and everything one should expect from a modern BC cabin. we have flown Emirates BC 4 times in the past 6 months and this cabin is comparable to both the A380 and the 777 in that class defining airline. Whilst we found the service in Emirates a bit disorganised AA was efficient friendly and warm we like the more mature no nonsense crew on Airlines out of the States although it's a thin line to rude and dis-interested on occasions! However AA should be ashamed scheduling a 200 version for the return leg which was not a result of a last minute 'change out' due to failure but that quote ' The newer plane has been stolen for Los Angeles some weeks ago'. Call me sad but I would have changed my flight if I'd known we'd be on this antique! Lie at an angle beds a 10 inch screen maybe 11 low def (love the jumpy fuzzy effects reminded me of the 90s) and the general feel of a very tired plane! What was different was the excellent service and food I was annoyed when I sat down but slept for 3 hours and was relaxed when I got off. AA has begun to catch up it's got some way to go and given the lounge experience (don't ever ever call sparkling wine Champagne!) there is a way to go the crew are spot on and at the end of the day that's what makes a flight. Seat score is for the 777-300ER but oddly it's not great for couples as these seats are very. 'Pod' like and chatting to each other isn't easy AVOD score is the new plane.;POSITIVE

american-airlines;2015-04-12;LHR-DFW return on 777-300ER. I booked this route especially to take this newer plane for the inflight entertainment which did not disappoint. I found the crew okay and some even smiled! What I disliked about AA was the exorbitant prices they charge for pre-allocated seats which was a necessity in order to seat a family of 4 together. The food was mostly below average but having read reviews I wasn't surprised. I don't like the way they have chosen to add another seat to each row in economy. So instead of 9 abreast they have made it 10. This makes the aisle ridiculously narrow and I don't see how hundreds of people would be able to escape in an emergency so I'm surprised the FAA permits this higher density seating. Legroom was tight for anyone of above average height. I also found it strange how the seat belt sign was illuminated for virtually the whole flight - in both directions - and there are hardly any announcements from the flight deck even when turbulence is quite choppy. I chose AA for the equipment they use on this route but I would think twice about booking them again due to the hidden costs that aren't factored into the ticket price.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-06;Flew Boston to Barbados via Miami March 10 returning March 17. Managed to buy a cheap upgrade to First Class Boston to Miami which was good - though American airlines first class doesn't measure up to the first class of other airlines. One good flight out of four. The rest was economy all the way and truly miserable. Miserly leg room have to pay extra for everything ground staff ranged from hostile to comatose cabin crew completely indifferent. Was made to feel like a dollar bill squeezed till I squeaked. AA operates for its shareholders not its passengers.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-06;Flew from San Francisco to DFW (Dallas) for my connection into Houston Hobby (04/05/15) just to sit around for hours the airline changed the departure time at least 7 times then in the end it was cancelled and do you think they had the decency to have a ticket agent at the booth no mysteriously the agents all disappeared right before the cancelled notice went up on their board. No one instructed us to do anything I went to other agents and they just told us they could not help. Just ridiculous all around meanwhile Mother's and children traveling alone sitting at the gate crying trying to figure out how they were going to get home. I ended up having to get a rental to make it to my final destination on my own. All American Airlines does is inconvenience people the final straw was when the agents at the rental car counter stated that American does this every week to folks who are going to Houston Austin and Lufkin so it was nothing new to them they claim mechanical failure! If they supposedly have new planes and they are investing in all this new equipment where is it? Why don't they use some of those new so called planes they have purchased! This was a less than an hour flight come on American have some common sense!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-03;From LAX to PVG (Shanghai) the worst business class. Most of the flights to Asia have much better business seating. The middle row has three seats if you are in the middle of the middle row you must cross someone to get in and out. The seats configuration is old and looks very dark and unpleasant. Larger screen for movies but not very many good selections.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-03;AA are making a big thing about all the new planes they are buying. I flew from Heathrow to JFK 27th March on a really smart 777. That's where the complements end though. I have never flown with a worse cabin crew. They all wore different clothing as though they had turned up from home and not bothered to change. They were totally uncommunicative - amazingly not a word was spoken to us through the entire journey. One of the crew fell asleep in a seat at the back of the cabin. Food was served as though they were doing us a favour and just dropped in front of us without a word there was not a friendly smile between them. One of the crew was not tall enough to close the overhead lockers. I cannot believe AA are spending so much on renewing their fleet yet seem totally unconcerned that their staff are behaving in this way. I flew back on BA - a fabulous crew who worked their socks off for the customers what a contrast!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-04-01;AA flight 397 on March 25th. The first leg of our trip was delayed so we arrived at the gate 7 minutes before the flight was to take off. We had notified the gate agents that we were on the way to the flight but they shut the door in our face and would not let us board. We found out they had overbooked the flight by 50 seats. On the next flight we watched as friends of the gate agents boarded on standby while the rest of us were bumped > again. No gate agents seemed interested in helping us get home. We eventually had to rent a car and drive home since American Airlines would not give us a seat on any flight to get home. An extra $100 and 10 hours delayed we arrived home.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-29;LHR to MIA Business Class. The plane was one of the older 777-200 with 2-3-2 seating meaning that the person in the middle always had to disturb someone to get out. The seat was ok but not really a true flat bed. The VOD was patchy in that on two of the films I watched there was something wrong with the display so I had to stop it and restart it. The food was very nice - my steak was delicious. Cabin crew were all very friendly and accommodating.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-28;Travelled with AA February 2015 LHR-MIA return flight out older plane - adequate for a day flight. Thankfully new plane with fully lie flat bed. On return excellent service from cabin staff food also beyond expectations.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-28;I flew Manchester to JFK and return with AA. On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all. Lets face it food comfort etc are also important but if an airline fails on basic safety the rest pales to insignificance.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-25;I have the time to write this review due to the third delay I've had with this airline. Not a single good thing I can say about my experience with American. I have flown Southwest Delta Jetblue Frontier and this is by far the worst airline I have flown. We had an hour and a half delay the first flight plus an emergency situation so we missed our connecting flight which has never happened to me. They supplied us with the worst hotel overnight. It wasn't just us that missed our flight 5 other families on separate ones missed theirs too. Then the flight the next day got delayed 30 minutes! So our three day trip turned into one day from all the delays and missed flights. Finally heading home and they announce mechanical problems with the plane. So now the flight is delayed 2 hours and we are missing our connecting flight to Salt Lake. So we get to board on a 6 pm flight but let's not kid ourselves that'll be delayed too so probably 7. And then it's a 4.5 hour flight so I'll be getting home at 2am. Other airlines can figure it out so please do to and spare us all the pain and frustration.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-23;"Due to a booking snafu (which may have been of my making) and the flight being oversold our non-stop return flight LHR-RDU was unavailable. The courteous and helpful ticket desk staff re-booked our free ticket LHR-JFK-RDU. We were told with great pride that the transatlantic portion would be aboard AA's new flagship 777-300ER. I applaud AA as being the only U.S. airline to give it's customers the opportunity to ride the latest and finest of American ingenuity technology and manufacturing excellence. It did strike me however that AA may have commissioned a ""lite"" version of the plane as it was missing some of the bells and whistles I had seen on some foreign carriers (wood floors mood lighting etc). Overall the economy interior can best be described as bland. On the plus side mammoth overhead bins decent seats great ride and as good an in flight entertainment system as you'll find anywhere in coach. Watched three excellent first run movies. All we need now is some edible food and AA will have caught up with BA and VS. However as a word of caution to those flying from the US to the UK on AA be aware of the aircraft type when you make your booking. In addition to the new AA Flagship 777-300 the airline also flies the 777-200 which is getting along in age the venerable 767-300 and the 757-200 which in my opinion is not at all suited to Transatlantic travel.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-20;New York (JFK) to Antigua during the very bad snow on the US East Coast. Early morning departure was going well until we reached the gate and found that a problem with a burst pipe meant no baggage could be loaded. However assume this was a knock on from the weather conditions. We were kept relatively well informed about delay which extended to around 3 hrs. However the anticipation of arriving in 85 degrees warmth mitigated the delay. Service on aircraft was fine. We had seats with extra leg room. Inflight entertainment ok. Only soft drinks were free. We had an egg sandwich which was OK. Flight back was also delayed slightly but made up time to arrive near to scheduled time. No queue at immigration. However all this came to nought due to baggage problem at aircraft which meant we waited an hour for bags to arrive. No complaints about flight crew either way - clearly not as customer focused as Non US airlines but efficient.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-18;Flew RDU-LHR on a free economy ticket. I prefer other airlines but the RDU-LHR non-stop convenience trumps all. It also gives me the opportunity to judge the progress of the AA/USAir merger. On the downside the venerable 767-300 is one year older (27 years and counting) still has the mail slot overhead storage bins the ancient hanging screen entertainment and the excruciatingly uncomfortable seats. I did notice that this old warhorse had been updated with blended winglets to save money which I'm certain they pass along to those paying for tickets. On board the hot breakfast croissant has been replaced with a box of sugar laden treats and the dinner has regressed from merely uninteresting to inedible. The flight attendants are excellent given what they have to work with - even giving up their crew rest seats to accommodate the spring breakers who made this a 100% full flight. On the plus side a current movie that I had considered paying to see (Whiplash) swift check-in and 45 minutes early into LHR. AA doesn't seem challenged to upgrade their transatlantic game but unless you're flying from RDU there must be a better option to get from the U.S. to the UK.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-18;Flew JFK to Manchester. First disaster came when checking in for flight to be told as a group of 6 we couldn't be seated together. Then it got worse as we couldn't be sat as couples unless we paid $260.00 per couple. Once on board we were sat apart. The cabin crew were at best unkempt and rude. The meal we were served was awful. Only 1 toilet was working for the full economy cabin on a 757 this is not good on a 6 hour flight. Overall a disappointing experience and will not fly on American again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-18;AA 280 ICN to DFW. Was flying with an economy ticket got an upgrade to business kind of last minute. Aboard as my husband was flying in first class (empty cabin) the purser invited me to join him. What a difference it makes. So glad for the double upgrade in the same flight. Service was good purser was friendly service oriented and professional. The 777-200 is showing its age but the first class suite is still very comfortable.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-17;AA78 DFW-LHR March 6 2015. What a disappointing flight on one of AA's ancient 777-200 cabin feels more like a prison cell than business class. Seats in 2-3-2 configuration (haven't had this for 15 years now). Instead of lie- flat seats they still offer lie in s-style and be careful not to slip down to the floor while you sleep. Stewardess climbing over me to cut off the way she had to walk. Food was disappointing as well. Only highlight was the wine selection that was a little bit better than ok. No way that I will use AA again.;NEGATIVE

There were only two small things I did not get - table - very difficult to pull out and angle - to a point flight attendants had issues with it. And second was iPad for entertainment? Really. The planes have new seats! What was worst was that the purser collected the iPads and head phones 4 hours before we landed! So there was no entertainment. And when I asked why they collected it so early they said they were preparing for landing. 4 hours ahead? The same on 777-300ER they keep collecting the headphones at least 1 hour before landing therefore you can't use the system. But the food was ok and apart from the unfriendly purser the staff were nice.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-17;What is the point in paying extra for Priority when the seats are still the same size? Not to mention the overhead bins are not full yet you made me check my one carry-on. This is ridiculous. I planned ahead and packed lightly so I could use a small carry bag. I have an appointment when I land and cannot wait for Baggage Claim. What should have been offered was Priority Baggage PickUp. These items should come off the plane first and be stowed with strollers or other items along with First Class baggage. I will avoid this airline at all costs going forward.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-17;DUS-ORD-Tampa-LAX-ORD-DUS. We fly on European carriers quite often - but American Airlines have made an art of employing non caring - ignorant and unfriendly staff. I have never encountered such condescending flight attendants - and such arrogance. We flew from Dusseldorf to Chicago as first leg. The seat allocation was a disaster at the airport - my wife was in a middle seat 6 rows behind me. When we asked the check in crew to change it - we were told to take care of it at the gate at the gate we were told to sort it with the cabin crew and the cabin crew? Not our problem - you should have taken care of it before boarding - end of interest. Only after I really got angry - and walked off the plane - telling them to get my luggage off - a steward from the front end of the plane got involved and shuffled people around so we could sit together. Our friendly stewardess then managed to ignore us for the whole trip. Second leg - we were on the last row of an ancient DC9 - with the galley next to us and a toilet door that would not close properly. Return trip uneventful - but one thing is certain - never again American.;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2015-03-17;I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions. It used to be a great carrier.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-09;Sitting at AEX. Flight 3271 was scheduled for 6.05am. It is currently 8.20am and still not boarded. There is always delays. I travel for business and American is so inconsistent it makes it hard for the business traveler.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-09;Recently we traveled to Cancun from Calgary Canada with an over nighter in Dallas Fort Worth. Our flights down were for the most part uneventful with only minor delays out of Calgary and Dallas. However coming back on the 28th of Feb was the worst experience we have ever had in over 30 years of flying. We were stuck in an enormous backlog of passengers in Cancun Airport the majority of the backlog was with American Airlines. Not withstanding the fact that there were storms all over the southern US the American staff assisting passengers in the line-up un-organized cluster that accrued in the terminal was appalling! They could not organize anything and upset passengers constantly. They were so incompetent that they would have had difficulty organizing a staff bathroom break. We where in the line-up for 5.5 hours and never saw a listing for our flight till we finally went through security and even then they had the gate location mixed up. A horrendously poor experience.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-09;"I had an unpleasant experience with this airline on Sunday March 1st. I took a flight from Houston to Chicago then had an hour to connect to my flight to Toronto. The first leg was fine on time and was surprised that a meal was served on a short two hour flight. I got to Chicago checked the departure board and saw my flight was delayed an hour. That was not too bad so I used the washroom came out to get a coffee and decided to check the board for the gate again and to my surprise my flight was then listed as cancelled. Told that even though I had booked first class if I wanted to get to Toronto the next morning it would be in the back of economy told that the only first class available would be in two days. The biggest surprise came shortly thereafter when I went to search for a Customer Relations desk: there was none! There was a system of phones. Eventually a CS agent came to the phone. She told me that the previous gate agent booked me for the following night from Chicago to Philadelphia then a six hour wait to board a 7 am flight back up to Toronto getting me to my destination two days after the original time. I instead took charge and asked if I could get a flight to Buffalo and was placed on one for two hours later. Of course ""weather"" was the cause for the delay but oddly enough only my flight was showing up as being cancelled. I fly often so if weather was a major factor the board should have at least a few more cancellations or delays. Because of this ""weather"" excuse there would be no assistance for a hotel. I was to depart from the L gates and just before boarding there came an announcement that we had to go over to the H gates- - with just minutes to spare. Service has been much better to me by other US based airlines when faced with unusual changes such as weather or mechanical delays-I have had them all. I will stick to my preferred airline and not use AA anymore as this experience plus a similar one last summer with them has completely eroded any confidence that this airline can get me from point A to B on the same day.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-09;MSP-MIA. A battered old airplane arrives at the gate looking like it would be from 1960. We got inside and some of the monitors were not working and the seats barely reclined. The flight attendants were very nice and passed out drinks but I still don't understand why they do not offer snacks on a 3.5 hour flight. My flight from MIA-MSP was terrible. We arrived at MIA airport getting ready for our flight at 1pm. We find out it is cancelled and the airline did not give us a reason why so we were rescheduled for a 2pm flight. When we went to board the 2pm flight we find out that they cancelled our seats for that flight and replaced them with a 9pm flight. We had to stay in MIA airport for an additional 7 hours! Once the time finally comes to board the flight bound to MSP we get onto the plane which previously came from Mexico City. The flight attendants were very welcoming however they then tell us over the speaker that this plane was out of service and that American Airlines must find us a new plane to fly on. So we get all of our luggage off the plane and leave the gate once again tired and exhausted. We wait in the gate area and find out our plane is located at the opposite end of MIA airport a 25 minute walk/train ride to get to. So we get all of our stuff together and head towards the other gate. Boarding begins immediately on one of the brand new planes and it is delayed an additional hour. The flight finally leaves at 11pm and I was supposed to be home at 6pm originally. We got to Minneapolis at 2am. Do not recommend this airline if you have little kids with you as changes to occur commonly but the flight attendants are great. The flights not so much. American has really gone down in service.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-04;After a cruise in Ft. Lauderdale we took a connector flight to Dallas on the way to Phoenix. Upon arrival had to sit in the plane 2.5 hours as there was a plane in our gate. Because of snow and ice on runway and also because Dallas is not prepared for this and American could not find a pilot we were cancelled. So for the next 24 hours we spend in the Dallas Fort worth airport we spend 8 hours waiting in lines for a flight and slept along with about 100 people on the floors and in chairs in the airport as the hotels were full. I felt sorry for seniors would had to endure this drama as there was little to no help from American Airlines. Finally after 2 cancellations and 1 standby refusal we found a flight to Phoenix.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-04;Flight from MSP to DFW to MIA was late both flights and each time they were highly unorganized. Late to board and very uninformative to passengers. Flight itself ok. Very uncomfortable seats and I'm an extremely small figured person. Flight returning from MIA to DFW and then to MSP was a disaster! Got to the airport 2.5 hrs early and had American Airlines bump my flight unbeknown to me to a following day! They put me on standby with a confirmed seat and then argued when I didn't get on that I was late when I was there an hour before departure. They did not out me on and when talking to a supervisor and his pawn they did nothing claiming it was not their fault even though I had a confirmed seat on time and they bumped me. They did nothing to appease the situation and the girl behind the counter was very rude! I will never fly them again. Disorganized unprofessional and expensive!;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2015-03-04;Flew AA Cost Rica-Miami-Toronto. Ancient airplanes with drop down televisions every few rows. Couldn't read anything on the screens. Staff unhelpful and I never saw one of them smile. The man beside me (mistakenly) asked to purchase some cheese and crackers. The attendant literally threw a menu at him and hissed that they didn't have cheese and crackers. The seats were painfully thin and I could not get comfortable even in the Exit row isle. The only bonus you got a full can of pop although I asked for ginger ale and they didn't have any. Service only came through once and people were all complaining that they were parched and would like water.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-04;Booked on a Sunday morning flight from Miami to New York. Arrived at 6.50 for an 8.10am flight. There must have been 10 lines along a large expanse of the terminal. We were misdirected 4 times to the wrong line. The lines were 4 layers thick and moved incredibly slowly. We stood on one line for 40 minutes before we began to fear we would miss our flight because of the slow pace of check in. The American line attendants were unhelpful. They suggested self- check in but I explained that I had a dog. He then told me I was in the wrong line. The correct line was equally long and I missed my flight. I will never travel AA again. There are other choices between Miami and NY and AA is not less expensive.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-04;Flew from Philadelphia to Dublin old plane unfriendly staff - one screen for 50 people and 1 movie in 5 hours. Pasta and bread tasted the same and fixed recline for seats. Unsatisfactory! Will switch to another airline next time.;NEGATIVE

After four calls and ""It can't be fixed"" answers it was finally fixed via email. Of the four segments all but the first ones were quite enjoyable. The first a red eye out of LAX was average at best. Smooth boarding rock hard seats that sent my back into pain an hour out. surly unhelpful FA's. As we approached the gate in MIA the FA gave us connection information which was wrong. Had we not checked a board in the terminal we would have been sent so far out of our way we would have missed our flight. The other 3 flights were fine except for the MIA-SXM meal which was inedible. Planes were old but fairly well preserved. All flights on time. At SXM our ""priority"" bags were the last off the plane. Overall small stuff.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-03-04;I cannot find one thing to say about this airline that is complimentary. Had a flight from Orlando to home and arrived 2 hrs early. Line and kiosks were absolutely packed. And why is that? Because there are only 2 check in people working. Of course I am late for my flight and spend the rest of the day trying to get on a stand by. AA workers at the gates very unhelpful and dismissive. Tell me if I am not some kind of gold customer I cant be put on a stand by list. Terrible customer service in every way. I will never fly them again and do not recommend anyone else to either!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-02-24;"I am mostly an international flyer on Qatar Etihad and BA. I have been flying American a lot in the US in the past 18 months and have to say I have been pleasantly surprised. This weekend there was a bad storm that closed Washington area airports and I had to get back from Miami to make an international departure the following day. Two of my flights were cancelled. The agent at the Admirals Club stuck with it for almost an hour as we strategized a way to get near enough to DCA so I could have options to get home (eventually I got to PHL and rented a car). The only slightly sour note was the agent's supervisor came over saying ""no...no...no.."" and she couldn't be bothered with trying to understand what we were trying to do. Seeing I was now getting really angry the supervisor pulled back and the agent got me near enough on a USAir flight. USAir had their own agent in the Club and he got us on a waitlist for an even earlier flight which proved to be a Godsend. And after all that my baggage eventually made it to DC after the storm with no drama. Of course I am Oneworld Gold and we were flying first class and I didn't have to stand in a mile long line in the main terminal. But that's what you're paying for and often US airlines don't treat you very well no matter how much you paid for the ticket. I also have found AA is incredibly helpful on the phone in changing reservations even on codeshare flights which is something I have to do frequently.

She needs Gluten Free food but her meal was terrible some chicken and rice which again was cold. When my wife made comments to the senior steward she told us that due to AA cutbacks they are withdrawing special meals.

I wish the in-the-air product always equalled the consistently excellent service we receive at the Platinum desk. Based on three of the four flights we found the experience professional.

american-airlines;2015-02-18;LAX-DFW-MEX and return - First/Business Class. My expectations were set fairly low as these were my 11th and 12th transit of DFW on American over the last 6-7 years but wanted to burn off some miles. Of these trips I can now say that 2 have departed on time out of this place. That said my trip down to MEX was uneventful. Food was fair at best and F/A's smiles seemed missing but was on time. The departure out of MEX back to Dallas was delayed by Radar problems at MEX. This set off a chain of events that resulted in a missed connection at DFW and while 90% could be attributed to the Radar problem. The flight was not posted on airport monitors and the gate was changed. The departure gate did not have the flight displayed so people had to ask if this was indeed for the DFW flight. Once on board the pilot announced a 59 minute traffic delay due to an early full ground stop. That 59 minutes went by plus another 20 or so with no further word from the crew. Late passengers arrived about an hour after the scheduled time and once loaded the door was shut and we pushed back. Since I signed up for Emails I received no fewer than 14 Emails that I didn't read until arrival in DFW which caused connection confusion that even one of their agents could not explain. As it turned out due to carry on bag only I could have made my first flight but apparently they gave my seat away thinking there would be no way I could make it. Coming into DFW I checked online and it showed what looked like I had been rebooked on the 2nd of 2 remaining flights but Emails after arrival which were generic made me think I had been rebooked on the first of the two. All 3 remaining flights were at different terminals which didn't help. Food offered on both return legs was ridiculous same thing on both flights which means they boarded the little biscuit sandwiches at DFW flew them to MEX to serve on the return flight.;NEGATIVE

Seat comfort was reasonable for a 1 hr 37 min flight. One flight attendant was extraordinarily rude and sassy loudly scolding numerous passengers about a number of trumped up infractions. Return flight to JFK was overbooked so we and others were hauled into an American Airlines office told we would have to be rebooked the following day. After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person. American is clearly not very customer friendly and one would think twice about flying with them again in the future. JetBlue as it turned out had more leg room served a snack and their crew onboard was much better organized and politer than American had been.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-02-11;AA0071 1/12/2015 FRA-DFW. Actually my flight was with Etihad however the connection from Frankfurt to Dallas Fort Worth was with American Airlines. The plane outside looked great however once I boarded it looked like I was still in the 1960's. Damaged/not working light switches ugly and dirty seats and the 12 hour long flight had no monitor to watch anything. I will try to avoid American Airlines in future.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-02-06;AA86 on Jan 22: ORD-LHR 767-300. Used Flagship Lounge before boarding - always great service there and one of the ladies always remembers me with a hello and chat. Boarding was quick - seat 6G and Business Class was full. Coach was around 70% full. Greeted by attendant on boarding and once at my seat attendant came and took my jacket and offered water/champagne/OJ. Took off on time and post-take off drinks were served with nuts. Dinner was halibut that was excellent and the F/A's were very attentive. Bose headsets always great and Samsung tablet had sufficient shows to watch. Slept 4 1/2 hours and asked for breakfast - was brought right away. Circled a couple times and landed at Terminal 3 - off the plane quickly and transferred to T5 for flight to Brussels. Really think AA is doing great - hope it continues.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-02-06;On 1/18 flew from Omaha to DFW to New Orleans. Flight very uneventful. Even arrived in Dallas early and had to wait for another plane to pull out so we had a gate to pull up to. Made the connection to New Orleans easily and the flight was on time. On 1/25 flew from New Orleans to DFW to Omaha. Flight was on time until we boarded in Dallas and wait to wait nearly an hour so light bulbs on the wing could be replaced. Since I don't fly much I was satisfied that the flights for the most part were on time and uneventful.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-02-06;GRB to HNL via ORD and DFW. Five of 6 segments were on time or up to 30 minutes early. Ground and cabin staff were personable passed beverages 4 times on long-haul outbound but service was very lean on return (no coffee on a flight arriving at 5 am). Cabins clean seats adequately cushioned but a tight fit as expected. The entree salad I purchased was tasty and priced fairly. Entertainment is really inadequate on B767-300 with overhead video and no music channels at all on return. Unfortunately American Eagle is really a hot mess except for nice cabin staff. On final segment five schedule changes were sent to my phone in a 30 minute period-30 minute delay no just 5 minutes back to 30 minutes etc. The final message indicated just a 5 minute delay but after we boarded we sat on the plane for another 50 minutes while they located a new captain anyway. In my experience if you must use American Eagle shoot for the first flight of the day.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-02-06;We used American for the first and last time 1/5/14 for a flight to Cabo (flight 1087). We had a transfer in Chicago that's where the nightmare began. We arrived 15 minutes early but had to wait for almost 1.5 hrs to get off the plane. The pilot said the gate was not clear yet because we were early then they were de-icing then the baggage handlers then crew problems. Our connecting flight was delayed an hour so we would just make it. The flight was scheduled for 10 am delayed until 11 but no gate given then 12 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 then 6. We found out sometime after 2 that the plane was in Seattle. They never offered an apology although they did give us 12 dollar meal vouchers. We got 2 sandwiches and had to pay for our sodas. We were scheduled to be in Cabo at noon that day but did not get there until 10pm. A day of our vacation was lost 9 hours of aggravation and never offered any compensation for this terrible service. Just a quick comparison we went to Cancun in November on Southwest airlines they had a problem processing our boarding passes 20 minute delay we were afraid we were not going to be able to go but they got the problem fixed. If you have a choice for flights choose a company that cares.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-02-06;"In spite of the fact that we booked and paid for a $4K vacation a month before the actual travel AA wouldn't assign my husband and I actual seats. This meant we couldn't print out boarding passes before getting to the airport. However if we were willing to pay extra $ they would give us seat assignments. In coach. They were basically holding the seats hostage unless we paid a ransom to free them. When I enquired w/ AA as to why they actually said that our $4K payment gave us the ""service"" of flight/flying not the actual seat. They also said seat assignments were handled by the gate. An out and out lie since an extra $60 or more would have gotten us seat assignments on the spot.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-28;JFK-DFW-GRU-JFK. First leg on a brand-new 737 seats were comfortable and flight attendants were friendly. They went above and beyond looking for an item that I lost during the flight checking the seat cushions and pockets and profusely apologizing when they couldn't find it. Next leg on the 777-300ER. Seats were once again comfortable although legroom was a bit tight but was not much of an issue since I had the entire row to myself. Recline was excellent although it was a little too much that when the person in front of me reclined there was very limited space. Flight attendants on this flight were once again very friendly and professional. Catering was excellent both quantity and quality. Return flight to JFK on a 777-300ER again. This time seated in Main Cabin Extra. Legroom and recline was great there were plenty of space to move around. Flight attendants and catering were once again excellent dinner was one of the best meals I had on a plane. Service on this flight was very attentive. So Kudos to AA! The only issue was the IFE had to be rebooted a couple of times other than that the system offers a lot of variety and options. Overall as a loyal United customer I was pretty impressed with AA! Service was warm and friendly and the 777-300ER product is reliable and comfortable.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-28;"Flew from Seattle to Santiago via Miami. The flight to Miami was uneventful on a 737. The flight to Santiago left much to be desired on an antique 767. Seats were uncomfortable and stained. The meal was bland and unappetizing to look at - made the mistake of having the chicken. The old school ""entertainment"" system was a throwback to the 70's and the movie was only available in Spanish. It was a moot point though as I could not see the 12"" screen from a dozen seats away anyhow. The return flight was canceled. We were rebooked the next day on a 777 which was a welcome change. Unfortunately this plane was filthy and the FAs were quite rude. To cap it off as we were boarding we were stopped on the jetway and told that AA has a no outside drinks policy so we would have to throw out the bottles of water we bought airside before boarding our 10 hour flight. On the plane I timed it and after the original thimble of water it took 5 hours to get another one. I learned my lesson and AA will not get my business again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-28;Flight 1021 on January 24 from Granada to Miami. This was a terribly crowded and hot plane. Flight duration was about 3 hrs 45 mins. The flight attendants made a single pass through the cabin to offer drink service and pick up cups which took no more than an hour and a half. After this they were not seen for the last 2 hrs 15 mins of the flight. I found three flight attendants seated at the rear of the plane. I have never had worse inflight service and had never seen a more lazy group of flight attendants.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-26;London (LHR) to Los Angeles (LAX) via Chicago (ORD) in First. Bag drop at LHR was easy. Flagship lounge a little antiseptic but welcoming enough. Boarding straightforward. Plane on the transatlantic section looked a little tired inside but the seat was enormous and very comfortable. Food and drinks very good and service outstanding. If I have a gripe it's that the IFE wasn't great and the TV of poor quality. Domestic leg was OK but I wouldn't expect the same class of treatment on such a flight.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-26;Booked flight and hotel with Travelbag and was horrified to discover that I was flying with AA! We flew economy from Heathrow to Miami Miami to San Jose. Check-in was good and we got good exit row seats on the first flight. Second flight we got bad seats and rude staff. Return journey again we got good exit row seats but had more bad staff does AA specialise in them? Not as bad as I thought but due to rude staff I won't be rushing to fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-26;"Flight 287. Our Flight was supposed to be non-stop from Miami to LA. Plane developed a problem as we sat waiting to leave the terminal. It took 2 hours to determine it was not fixable. We were compensated with headsets and two granola bars while we waited for the news that American Airlines was trying to find another plane. No plane was available so we deplaned and waited another hour in the terminal for the decision to fly to Phoenix where we could refuel on the same plane and go on to LA. By now the flight is 4 hours late leaving. Arriving in Phoenix the captain said ""Good news is we are in Phoenix the bad news is the crew has to stand down due to FAA regulations."" Another delay - All the passengers were shuttled around to other flights. It's late we are all exhausted and had been lead along by a string of lies. We missed our connecting flight by 6 hours and had to stay in LA. Two granola bars and a pair of headsets. One lie leads to another creating distress for the passengers and the consequent employees that had to deal with the avalanche that resulted from a full-flight of unhappy flyers. It was a nightmare. I will never fly American again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-23;DFW to Milan Italy via JFK in December 2014. On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-23;I have 2 children. One is 8 month and the other one 2.5 years. They don't give priority to board the plane to families with babies nor seniors. Secondly the staff who help you when you are checking in are useless. When you get to the airport you have to check in using their computers but if you are traveling with infants you have to line up for more than an hour. When we lined up an AA employee approached us and confirmed that we were in the right line. One hour later the staff member who was about to help us check in said that we were in the wrong line. Once at the gate they didn't give preference to families with babies. Somebody said through the speaker that there wasn't enough room for our carry-ons and that we had to check them in at no cost. When we approached the staff member at the front desk guy to ask him where to leave the carry on he ignored us. Lastly this airline charges you extra for your luggage. Our ticket was very expensive and on top of that we had to pay extra for our baggage. This is the first and last time that I travel with them.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-21;I try to avoid them whenever I can but as a student I have to go for the cheapest so I gave them another try from Miami to Milan. First of all no private screens on a 9 hour journey should be banned. Although I did sleep most of the time I would have liked to listen to some music or watch a movie of my choice not chosen by them. Besides that the aircraft didn't seem very well kept and the food was just bad. To make the matter worse the plane was delayed by 6 hours and they kept changing our gate telling the plane was broken. Would try to avoid them if you can.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-21;LHR-LAX flight in business class: new 777 aircraft. Excellent flight very attentive crew (best ever on AA) good IFE and WiFi which was a great treat - $19 for a 10 hr flight is not unreasonable but you would perhaps expect to be free of charge for First and Business Class travelers? SFO-ORD-LHR: flights in Main Cabin Extra. The usual 737 for the internal flight which was fine. Again attentive staff. The leg from ORD to LHR was on a very old and dated 767 which you really no longer would expect to exist in a company from a 1st world country? IFE broke down so everyone had to make do with their own entertainment options. Cabin crew were excellent again. I fell asleep as we took off and missed my meal when I woke up I was offered it within 10-15 minutes. I have had a fair few flights with American in the past to the US and because my partner has Executive Platinum status with them we always do tend to get upgrades to business class but have never thought much of the service so far. Clearly American is staff is making an effort! The quality of service has really improved.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-21;"Why is there always some ""breakdown"" with American? I live in Alexandria LA and only have three choices and unfortunately I am forced to fly AA. Normally only 1 out of 4 flight go without some type problem. Always late or delayed. Flight Crew doesn't show up. Gates are changed sometimes up to 5 times. And lost bags are the norm. Why can't AA get their game together?";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-19;In the air American was decent. We flew TUS-DFW-BNA and EVV-ORD-TUS and found the flight crew to be friendly and helpful for the most part. The issues we had were with customer service on the ground particularly in Dallas where our missed flight did not result in any support for our troubles. They also lost our luggage but they apologized and compensated us appropriately sending a check in a very timely manner. The MD-80s they fly are fine but the fact that I flew in a plane 5 years younger than me doesn't do much for my faith in the company. American Eagle's ERJs are horrible for anyone over 5 feet tall and they feel dated. The newer 737s were nice however.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-19;SAN-ORD-ROC and BUF-ORD-SAN. I decided to fly paid first as the cost when booking only a few weeks out was only slightly more than economy. I've flown AA first domestically many times so didn't expect much but flying so early in the morning it was nice to have a slightly larger seat to sleep. I'm only writing this review to point out what a drastic turn for the worse after the merger. The food quality while on domestic F is never great has always been better than the rest on AA. It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-19;Nov 10th AA2216. AA2463 Nov 11th. Our flight from LA to SYD was QF12 on Nov 11 2014. I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy. There were several flights that went from DFW to LAX that evening and they allowed over 30 people to board those planes on stand-by but would not allow us to.;NEGATIVE

Las Vegas to New York 4 Jan 2015 AA120. My partner and I were extremely disappointed with everything. All 4 flights were delayed not by few minutes but by hours. Later the staff would board all passengers on to the aircraft and in all the flights we would just sit on the tarmac for hours. Usually when you board the plane the CSD or the purser of the flight would greet you with a friendly smile and say welcome aboard or good morning etc. But in all the flights with AA they could not care less about passengers. Flight attendants were too busy talking to each other or. The grooming of the flight attendants was atrocious! Above all the flight attendants on all 4 flights were very rude and arrogant. They don't even bother to look or smile or talk politely with the passengers when they are boarding the flight. The seats in economy was so uncomfortable with minimal leg room. There is no comfort. It is okay for short flights but not very good for long flights like New York to San Francisco or Las Vegas to New York. We paid extra for extra legroom economy seats. Well AA should learn what extra legroom means. There was no extra legroom. The seats are terrible for tall people. I will never recommend AA.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-19;LAX-SLC on 18 July 2014 SLC-RDU on 25 July 2014 RDU-JFK on 28 July 2014. Typical AA flights and lounges- pretty ordinary. Not a patch on Qantas or BA. Ground staff at RDU did not recognise or acknowledge an international RTW J class ticket - denied baggage allowance. Had to pay $25 to check 1 bag. Why don't AA enforce carry-on bag rules? Many passengers with 3 or more overweight bags. Would we recommend AA to family & friends? Probably as they are 'less bad' than the opposition.;POSITIVE

american-airlines;2015-01-19;"Traveled three times round trip LAX to LHR in the last 4 months of 2014: flights 136 and 135. Equipment - 777 300ER (I go out of my way to fly this plane as it is the newest and most comfortable). Business Class. Seats J12 J13 and J14 (window seats). I can't say enough good things about the seat (private and roomy flat bed) the inflight entertainment (15"" screen) and the noise-canceling headphones (sized large enough to surround the ear rather than mashing it as do the headphones on BA). In all instances the food from LAX to LHR was not good and certainly not worth the calories (the same can be said for BA). Better to eat in the Admirals Club Lounge (more on this later). The food from LHR to LAX was much better and excellent on one flight (must have a better kitchen at LHR). The LAX Admirals Lounge is comfortable enough but it is unconscionable that long-haul business class passengers are required to pay for everything beyond bar snacks and coffee. I have never paid for food in the business class lounge of any other comparably-sized airline. And we were mislead (cheated) by one of the wait staff. As an aside BA shares the Admirals Club Lounge in San Diego and as a BA passenger I wasn't charged for food in the lounge there. The LHR Admirals Club Lounge is certainly spartan but well-tended and thankfully much less crowded than the BA lounge. In fact the AA lounge was just about empty on my three visits. Yes the food in the AA lounge is limited compared to BA but at least you don't have to pay extra for it as you do in all of the Admirals Clubs in the USA. Check-in was spotty at best and miserable at worst. At LHR we had to use the check-in desk for coach passengers because there was only one business class desk in operation. I would recommend AA but only for passengers flying business class in the 777 300ER aircraft.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-19;JFK-SFO-LAX-LAS-JFK with American Airlines were the worst four flights of my life! Ground staff and cabin crew were rude and inefficient. The cabin and seats were very old and worn out. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile. Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. I will never fly with AA again.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-19;I flew from LHR-MIA in Business on one of their new 777-300. I cant fault this flight. The seats in Business have lots of space places for storage and good size IFE screens. IFE itself is also good. Food was of a good quality. Service was very good from the crew who were pleasant friendly and were happy to keep your drink topped up. If you're feeling peckish during the flight the galley is stocked with snacks where you can help yourself. Overall a very pleasant on time flight. In contrast I flew the return with BA on a very worn 747 business class cabin is badly designed and crew not very friendly at all. If you are doing this route definitely choose AA over BA miles better product!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-19;I have never seen anything like I saw today at MIA. We arrived an hour and a half before my son's domestic flight and could not believe the chaos at American's ticket counters. There were long lines at every kiosk and even longer lines at the checked bag line. After finally checking in at a kiosk my son could not print his boarding pass because the machine had run out of paper. I had been standing in the checked bag line and when we approached the employee and explained that we had a luggage tag but the boarding pass had not printed she directed us to another line that had easily more than 60 people! I then approached another American Airlines employee and asked for assistance and she was incredibly rude and offered no help. Fortunately we were able to get my son's boarding pass on the phone. Despite a ridiculous security check-in line he was able to board his flight on time. A friend of his that was on the same flight had to forcefully argue with other employees to get on the flight because they said they had closed the gate and would not let him board even though he was checked in!;NEGATIVE

We boarded and when we were boarding they informed us that we had a stop in Goose bay Canada to have gas otherwise we would not be able to get to New York the stop was 1h 30m long. We arrive in JFK so late that almost everybody lost their connection. However we were given new connections once we got out of the plane. But they did not give us any voucher or anything in compensation for this horrible flight. I would try not to fly American Airlines again.;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2015-01-14;AA174 (Raleigh RDU-London LHR) on Dec 23 2014. We initially boarded the old rust bucket that is the 767-300 only to be disembarked a couple of hours later due to mechanical problems. They told us mechanics would have the problem fixed in 2 hours only for the inevitable announcement 3 hours later that they couldn't fix the plane and that we would depart the next morning. AA did provide hotels overnight but it was another 2 hour ordeal with 250 passengers lining up to see ONE representative. The next morning we all made our way to the gate boarded the same plane which the captain announced had been fixed and tested and waited for departure. Only we never departed. One hour later the captain announced the plane was STILL not fit to fly to the annoyance of us passengers. We had to wait a further 7 hours at the airport for another AA rust bucket 767 to come save us from London. After a 24 hour delay and 3 separate boardings for 1 flight we finally made it to London Christmas morning. My return flight (AA105) from London LHR to New York JFK operated on a brand new 777-300 was of course flawless. Lesson learned and tip: Do everything you can to avoid flying the 767 because chances are you won't be flying. They were good planes back in the 90's and 00's but they're unreliable these days. Moreover if you want entertainment and comfort avoid 767s at all costs. Ultimately AA is a good airline if you fly the right planes.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-14;"NRT/ORD 777-300 I hesitated booking F/class on AA even with award travel because of their flight attendants' general culture of hostility towards passengers but I reasoned I'd be asleep for much of the flight. We sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes before taking off. When returning to my seat from the lavatory after we'd finally reached cruising altitude a flight attendant looked at me coldly and barked ""Put your seat belt on!"". There was some turbulence but this was not the way to handle it. The purser was friendly and efficient but he referred to my husband as ""Mr.---- "" and called me ""Dear"". The new seats were very comfortable though and I liked that my husband and I could spin the seats to face each other while dining (although the food was surprisingly bad). I slept well on the comfortable flat bed. If the food and service were comparable to the seat it would have been a great flight. Until then I'll continue to book transpacific premium travel on Asian carriers.";NEGATIVE

Onwards to the departure gate screens indicated a 25 minute delay. Was not too concerned as had around 4 hours to connect onto BA flight once landed in JFK. We then spent 2.5 hours waiting at the gate with hardly any communication from AA staff apart from ""Its a weather delay"" turns out it was due to a faulty aircraft door. Anyway the four hour connection time was fast approaching and people were starting to become annoyed and very irritated. Finally ushered onto the aircraft at speed as we only had a window of 25 minutes to board and be airborne if not flight would be cancelled as the crew would be out of hours. We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare. Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served. I have honestly never been on an AA flight whereby the crew are smiling happy to serve you and are actually grateful for you flying with them and I have taken around 8 AA flights including across the pond the attitude at times is appalling. On the same holiday I was on a delayed Delta flight from Atlanta to Boston and the difference between staff was unbelievable was even given a free beer and sincere apology for the delay and more importantly was kept informed and the crew were cheerful and happy. AA manners cost nothing!";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-14;"I am a long time traveler and loyal to American Airlines however whoever designed these ""new"" planes must have been 2 feet tall. The design is terrible. I am a slim 5'10"" and sat in a ""premium"" economy seat from Washington DC/LA on a nearly 6 hour flight. I sat next to two other tall people making it even more unpleasant. I will start with the good American has finally come into the 21st century and provides individual screens for in flight entertainment but still not nearly as good as Virgin America which also offers many free viewing options TV etc. Chargers USB are improved as well. Now the bad - the leg room and more so the seat/tray table configuration (even in premium) is appalling and even worse if the person in front of you reclines their seat which is highly likely. In my case they did and my drink ended up in my lap. If the seat in front is reclined you are pretty much trapped. The head rest ""wings"" that allow you to rest your head from side to side are so small anyone with a normal size head could not possibly use. They are ridiculous. The seat pocket basically holds nothing forget stocking up on magazines and books for your long flight as you will be carrying them in your lap or chucking them on the floor. Though it's nice to fly in a nicer and newer plane it is just shocking that no consideration was given to traveler comfort on these new planes especially if you are a over 5'2"". Not sure how the American or Boeing CEOs didn't catch this. They must have only tested out first class or they are all really short!";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2015-01-11;On flight from Austin TX to Manchester UK on 12/21/14 - paid for the additional leg room which could be better but was ok however the seats are the most uncomfortable seats ever. The more leg room you get the narrower the seat gets! 8 hrs in a cramped seat is ridiculous. My husband and I had seats 15a & b and left the armrest up between us to give us room for our arms the passenger in seat c I am thankful to say did the same thing. Seriously removing rows of seats to gain additional leg room is one thing but reducing seat widths to cram in more seats is in my opinion the most ridiculous idea they ever had. The staff were not the best and a little on the rude side. I have flown AA every time I had flown to the UK but I am considering a different airline for future trips due to the seats mainly. The captain did a great job - the entire flight was smooth.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-11;I had to book a flight from Orlando to Manchester UK the day after Christmas for a family emergency so naturally looked for the most affordable flight which by a few dollars was AA also taking into account flight times. I have flown this route with many other airlines in the past and AA was by far my worst experience. Flight left 40 mins late but did make up the time with a tail wind so we arrived on time. Some of the cabin crew were downright surly others were very pleasant. As I can't sleep on planes I rely on watching movies to pass the time but with no in-seat screens there was nothing to watch. I will never fly AA again even if it saves me money.;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2015-01-11;American Airlines seriously needs to reconsider its business plan of overbooking every single flight on one day and how that affects passengers trying to make connections when one flight is late. They also need to train their employees to treat passengers with respect and provide more telephone customer service options that don't leave you waiting 45-51 minutes. My flight was 90 minutes late out of Miami and I therefore missed my connection to San Francisco and apparently every other flight was overbooked for the next 24 hours which is completely insane.;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2015-01-05;Supposed to leave Miami to Milan at 14.30 but delayed twice. In the end we left with 4 hours of delays. The plane was an old fashioned 767-300 seats were small and dirty. Entertainment was overhead screens far from our seats. A real nightmare.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2015-01-05;Flew First Class from Buenos Aires - Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777-200. The seats while dated are roomy with lots of leg room and storage space. Boarding was quick although the agents and gate security at EZE leave a bit to be desired. Our flight attendants were ok nothing remarkable. Food was filling and of fair quality. The seat is lie- angled and not super comfortable but comfy enough to relax and watch the dated IFE. I can't complain about sitting in First Class on this 11 hour flight but the whole experience was just mediocre.;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2014-12-22;Give credit where credit is due-on the 16th of December I boarded AA193 in First seat 3E to connect in JFK to AA1416 to BDA also in First seat 3E. Due to a technical fault we had about an hour delay in BOS and I was concerned that I (and my fellow connecting passengers) would miss our connections. The captain did his best to make up time and after arriving at the gate (12) the lead flight attendant asked passengers not connecting to remain seated and let passengers with connections to disembark first. My BDA flight was at gate 40 and I made the fligh t- with moments to spare! Upon arriving in BDA was very surprised to see that my 2 bags had also made it. Thanks AA for a good team effort - and please put the dinner service back on that evening flight.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-22;Flew business SJU-JFK-LHR. SJU-JFK leg on old 757 with no individual video screens and pretty tired cabin. Food was virtually inedible. Admirals Club lounge at JFK OK but I resent having to pay for a packet of crisps when I've paid thousands for a ticket. JFK-LHR was much better: new 777 with really comfy flat bed and amazing noise cancelling headphones. Food was still awful (but food is generally dreadful in the USA anyway so to be expected. Flight slightly late but overall pretty good - particularly like the fact I wasn't woken up until 25 minutes before landing.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-22;Round-trip from Miami to CDG Paris. Cabin seats with little to no leg space and I'm not a large person. I passed on the food on the return trip as the chicken dish on the trip from Miami to Paris was lukewarm and horrible. In recent years I have seen fares on the international flights rise rapidly and in my opinion they have done little to justify the price increase. In the future I will look for another airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-18;I had about a 10 hr non stop flight from Paris to New York. There was no in seat TV. Only 2-3 TVs in the aisle and they asked for $5 each for headphones to listen to the movies they were playing of their choice. All the flight attendants were rude. I needed a blanket but they denied this. Overall it was a lesson for me to avoid American Airlines flights wherever possible.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-18;Flying from O'Hare to DC - rude attendant who let several passengers on board with 2 bags some larger than my single carry-on. I had to stow my bag because I had a shopping bag. When I offered to collapse the bag and place it under the seat I was told that I could not carry both onto the plane. Once we boarded the plane we were kept on the ground for 3 hours without water and/or food for those of us unlucky enough to not have brought our own on board. When I asked an attendant if I could have a bottle of water I was told that no service could be provided and to be patient that we would be departing soon (this was about two hours before our flight took off). When the flight eventually took off we were offered options for snacks when I requested my option I was told that they had run out. Why offer an option at all? When the drink cart eventually made its way to me I asked for a coke and was given 1/2 a coke served for me in a cup. When I asked for a second one I was told that they had limited quantities. Outdated plane with the tv screens down the middle row. Horrible service - rude check-in attendants and complete incompetence from the entire crew. I will not fly American Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-18;Four hour fog delay from Midland to DFW. Sat on the Tarmac for a half hour to get to a gate at DFW. Then waited 45 min. on someone to open the door. Return flight was at 6.10pm - delay after delay and finally canceled at 9pm due to weather. Kicker is an AA flight left the same terminal an hour later for Midland. We couldn't schedule another flight to Midland until two days later. Agents were the rudest most disrespectful and uncaring people you would ever want to run across. If you ever desire to travel with AA don't.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-18;Flight from Chicago to Paris on Thurs (12/5/14) was nothing but miserable. AA brought two planes to the gate when neither could pass safety inspection. The big question is why the planes made it to the gate in the first place. Passengers were then told that another plane had been found (another gate) but it needed to be inspected cleaned and finally loaded - they did provide soda and pretzels during the 3.5+ hour wait (big deal). We finally boarded a not-too-clean plane (I found trash in the seat pocket) and it was cold for the entire trip. We saw the staff twice - once to serve what they call dinner and once when they served a cold breakfast. The trip was just plain awful and makes me want to give up travel by air altogether. One bright spot that has nothing to do with AA - it was a SMOOTH flight and we made it in record time due to a good tail wind.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-18;Travelled Business Class on a 777 LHR-JFK. Very impressed indeed! Cabin spotless crew helpful. Seat wider than expected and quite private. Huge amount of space and loads of storage places too - even a large wardrobe. Power points convenient (UK and US plugs both fitted). Good noise cancelling headphones. Quiet. I was in 3A which is a mini-cabin just behind First Class - I would recommend it again. AA Business class is better than BA First Class Wifi: speeds of 3-7Mb which was commendable and only £9 approx. for the whole flight - very reasonable too considering the technology costs involved. Food: ok but not special. However snack bar had loads of nice nibbles.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-18;AUS-DFW-LGA. First leg on a MD-80 old aircraft but very well maintained. Plane was spotless and the seats were comfortable especially the very plush headrest. Legroom was sufficient and flight attendants managed to a conduct a beverage service on a full flight despite a flight time of only 39 minutes. Connection at DFW was seamless. Flight to LGA on a 737-800 had the seat next to me empty which provided a more comfortable flight. Flight attendants were very young which was surprising. They were friendly and cheerful which is a nice change. Refreshments and entertainment were basic and WiFi was extremely slow. Was disappointed that I shelled out money for a slow connection that only started to speed up during descent.;POSITIVE

Cabin crew was pleasant but not overly friendly. All in all a good flight. Flight duration is only 2 hrs so not much time for entertainment and food. I would highly recommend AA domestic U.S. Flights operated on Airbus A319 aircraft vs. outdated and uncomfortable MD 80's.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-04;Manchester to New York. Their standards are poor even from arriving at the boarding gate - why split passengers into groups and then not pay attention to how those groups board the plane? Surely after business class and those with priority shouldn't the next set of passengers to board the plane be those at the rear. That process would help to ensure the plane left on time rather than almost 20 minutes late. Their fleet is old-fashioned with screens down the centre aisle which cannot be viewed from certain seats. The seats were uncomfortable - 8 hours spent in one of those is not a pleasant experience. We gained the impression that the crew and their requirements over-rode passenger considerations - clearing away too quickly before passengers had time to finish the poor quality meals having to be quiet whilst in the vicinity of sleeping staff and very few drinks/snacks being offered is not what long haul flights should be about. Even the crew's uniform was shabby.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-04;Terrible service for the money that you pay. We flew from Manchester to New York direct the inbound flight took 9 hours seats where uncomfortable they only had televisions in the aisle - no PTV and no headphones provided. Served food half an hour into the flight then left for 7 hours without anybody asking us if we needed a drink - received a smaller snack 40 mins before landing which made you feel you had to rush as they where already standing waiting for the rubbish before you had finished. The staff were unfriendly and rude. The flight home was exactly the same and to get a drink you had to walk to the back of the plane and ask yourself with more than one occasion being told they had ran out.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-01;Nov 22 AA 1520 El Salvador to Miami. AA 2487 Miami to Orlando. Will never use this airline again. Connecting flights at Miami are the worst specially international flights. They schedule connecting flights within an hour and a half apart yet they land every international flight at terminal D in Miami 5-10 mins apart. On top of all this their outbound flights are late and incoming planes have to wait to have a new gate. What is the issue with this immigration and customs are 1 hour behind making it difficult to connect. You would think the airline can have someone trying to help you get through or guide you to reconnect to another flight well that is not the case. They take their time and don't care about you.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-01;Flew from LAX to DFW DFW to Raleigh and Raleigh to LAX in August/Sept 2014.

american-airlines;2014-12-01;"I flew DFW-LHR-DFW on AA50 and AA51. Both sectors were on a 777-300er. This is an excellent aircraft. Very spacious quiet and comfortable. AA's business class is by far the best product across the Atlantic. (Make sure that you book on the 77W. If you don't you will get the inferior 777-200 and it really isn't as good as the 300er). The fact that there is only one seat for rows A and J means that you have two windows plenty of space and lots of privacy. The lie flat bed is comfortable and easy to operate. The IFE has plenty of movies TV shows and plenty to keep you entertained. The food is very good with good choices. The walk up kitchen is kept well stocked with many tasty things. You will not go hungry on this flight! The crews were great and of course the flight deck were professional and got us to our destination safely which is always a good thing! The on board wi-fi is fantastic but please don't be a bandwidth bore and use it for ""voice"" calls like the idiot across the aisle from me did all the way to London. He was so annoying I had to complain to the flight crew to get him to shut up. AA have a great product here if they drop the 777-300er on this route as I was told they were going to do it will be a mistake. I will not fly with them. I will have to find another carrier.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-12-01;FLL-DFW-LAX upgrade to First. I have to admit the 737-800's are ok but need a refresh. I flew the segment from FLL-DFW it was an upgrade. OK good service. Met service manager for AA sitting next to me. She could not have been nicer. Really pleasant flight. DFW-LAX on the new Airbuses 320-B really great for the length although the seats could recline a bit more considering it is a 3 hour flight and it is hub-hub for AA. Food was OK nothing to write home about but they will upgrade that so look forward to it. No pre-flight welcome drinks - big minus. The seats - great although all leather which is a set back for AA I tend to sweat a lot and I find fabric gives you a bit more breathing. Entertainment - better than British on international flights. Large screens great selections of movies TV this is where AA is getting their game above their competition but they need to keep going. Keep changing the selection more often and staying on top of it alla Emirates. Comparable to the best though. I fly a lot including ANA JL QF BA CX and AA is on par if not above in many. Soft product needs polishing food improvement and it will start being a world-class airline again.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-25;Multiple North American flights during month including ORD-AUS AUS-DFW DFW-PBI EWR-DFW DFW-YVR YVR-DFW DFW- PBI PBI-LAX. Traveling through the US and Canada during November found me on several AA flights most in first class with upgrades a few in economy. On balance the flights were ok nothing special no notable problems. Most flights were on or close to schedule service was generally better than expected. The biggest negative is AA's equipment on these routes. All B737 or MD Super 80 aircraft. Generally confining for mid-long haul domestic and the S80s are just so old it is a wonder that AA still uses them as much as they do - not a very passenger friendly aircraft.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-25;I flew with American Airlines on October 20th this year from Dublin to JFK with my husband and two sons 12 and 9. The staff onboard that day were excellent we had the back seats just beside the staff and each one of them could not have made our flight more comfortable. Being our first flight to America and travelling with our youngest son who has autism it was quite a worry but the staff made him and us very comfortable. We are travelling back to the states in 2015 and I will make sure it is with American Airlines.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-20;What began as a simple flight from San Jose CA to New York NY (JFK) connecting at LAX has resulted in frustration and anger. Upon arriving at San Jose international airport with two hours to spare my fiancé and I each checked a bag. Our flight was projected to leave at 2.45pm PST and read 'On Time' on the departures kiosk. Without any announcement or updates our flight arrived late had to be refuelled and in turn was 30 minutes delayed. We missed our connection at LAX by five minutes and after spending far too much time in the customer service office were rebooked on a 9.30 Delta flight to JFK. Told there was no need to check-in all we would have to do is go to the gate and speak to the representative at the counter. An hour before our flight we walk to the appropriate gate only to be told that while we were listed as passengers there were no seats for us and that American should have booked seats on our behalf. We returned to the customer service office spending an hour waiting in line. An American Airlines rep took us from counter to counter trying to find us two seats on any plane. The only availability was on a place via Nashville to LaGuardia with an hour layover. As we were boarding we were pulled off the plane because he had found us a direct flight to JFK which would make finding our bags that much better. Finally arriving in JFK at 7.15 am our bags were nowhere to be found.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-20;JFK to Orlando in First. Check-in staff very helpful to our party of 6 after arrival from London. Given access to Admirals Club because long-haul had been business class. Pleasant lounge but only stayed about 20 minutes. Priority boarding and seats comfortable for a medium-length domestic flight. Captain announced that he would delay take-off whilst 35 passengers from a delayed European flight made the transfer and took off when about half that number had boarded. But the real surprise was when the flight attendant came round and said that because of the timing (early afternoon) there was no catering on the flight. Thus a 3-hour flight with just several rounds of a basket containing nuts biscuits and crisps - not a first class offering. Other than that the whole experience was much better (with arrival only slightly delayed) than I had feared given some of the reviews on here.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-17;Paid for F Class JFK-MCO via MIA. AA's JFK Terminal is beautiful. Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next. Gate agents and Admirals Club unable to contact ops via phone for updates. No words. Next plane boarded later than promised with no reason offered. Short Flt to MCO uneventful after 2 plus hour delay. There are some things to improve at AA but there is a lot right.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-17;"Based upon our experience of American Airlines' flights from the USA to the UK several years ago and to reduce the effects of jet-lag my wife and I decided to take the daytime flight AA90 which departs Chicago (ORD) at 09.05 and arrives in London (LHR) at 22.45. In retrospect this was a mistake. The Chicago Admiral's Club lounge was most disappointing. Surprisingly no food (unless you paid for it) was available except a few sad-looking bagels and muffins. So we were hungry when the flight took off. We were seated in seats 2A & 2B (the first row on the B767-300ER aircraft) and the seats were comfortable enough with good leg room. However the aircraft was certainly showing its age. In business class (there is no first class on this flight) there are no seat-back screens and the passengers are given small tablets and Bose headphones on which to watch movies. The movie/music selection was poor and was nothing to get excited about. The food that we were served (breakfast and a pre- landing ""snack"") was probably the worst airline food we have ever experienced. It was virtually inedible and it compared extremely unfavourably with the food that we were served in British Airways business class on our flight to the USA three weeks earlier. Furthermore the cabin attendants were virtually invisible. On the eight-hour flight I was never once offered tea or coffee - all I was given was a bottle of water to drink. Two hours before the flight landed in London I had to find a flight attendant and ask for a Bacardi and Coke - no flight attendant ever asked me if I would like something to drink. Unlike British Airways business class on our American Airlines flight we could see no sign of a basket in the kitchen area containing anything to snack on (like bars and sweets). American Airlines do you think that this is acceptable? Just what are business class passengers paying several thousand dollars/pounds over the economy fare for? (You do not arrive any earlier than the people sitting in the back). The food and service we experienced on our flight from ORD to LHR were completely unacceptable and based on our recent experience fear that it will be a very long time before we fly on American Airlines in business class again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-17;My wife and I flew from San Jose (SJC) to Chicago (ORD) on AA1530 in first class. San Jose is certainly a very pleasant little airport but unfortunately there is no American Airlines Admiral's Club room for first and business passengers. Our seats on the aircraft (3A & 3B - the first row of seats on the B737-800) were fairly comfortable and there was enough leg room. We had pre-ordered our meal on-line and it was described as miso chicken. Our meals although nicely served were of very poor quality so much so that my wife refused to eat any more after the first few mouthfuls. The flight attendant who looked after us was pleasant. courteous and helpful. But the three-hour flight as far as we were concerned was spoilt by food of very poor quality - not what you expect when you are travelling first class.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-17;DFW to LHR on new 777-300. Although American has updated their fleet and now have a business class seat that competes with most European carriers they really need to improve the service standard and the selection of their cabin personnel. Flight attendants were in a hurry to finish service and rude the quality of food just average and the presentation and amenities nothing remarkable. There was not the feeling of being in Business class on this flight.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-12;"LAX-Las Vegas (Return). Given its only a 40 minutes flight each way - not much can go wrong. The Flagship lounge at LAX was fine. Above expectations. Decent food and beverages. Spacious and quiet- and one I'd recommend. Flight both ways was on a brand new (you could ""smell"" it was brand new) on an A321 - a plane I'd not heard of - but apparently the ""new"" big brother to the A320. Great plane - in fact I'd say superb. Nice roomy first class that I'd be happy with on a 3-4 hour hour flight. Nice FAs. Plane both ways was rammed from end to end. Both flights left on time and landed ahead of schedule. What was noticeable was the gloomy faces on the return. assume this was down to losing to many dollars at the casinos - rather than the AA experience. All in all - a good experience.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-12;AA 262 B737 RSW to DFW 1st November 2014 good flight in First Class comfortable seat food surprisingly good for short flight no personal IFE seat not as good as US Airways A320.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-12;AA 50 DFW to LHR 777-300 1st November 2014. New Business class seating 3A beats BA's Club World product hands down IFE excellent Food OK - welcome drink in plastic cup. Overall would always look at AA's Business product if it was the new one over BA.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-12;I flew American for the first time today and will never fly with them again. My entire experience was horrible. My flight was delayed for 2 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight. So in addition to having already spent my whole morning in an airport I had to have my second flight rescheduled which cost me an additional 2 hours of wait time. Then my second flight is delayed 30 minutes because according to the pilot they hadn't removed the Jetway tunnel. Finally I arrive at my destination only to be informed that my luggage ended up on a different flight from mine and that I would have to wait an additional hour and a half before that flight arrived. Never using them again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-11;We flew AA from Minneapolis to Chicago (ORD) to NY (LGA) - JFK to Paris (CDG) and MIA to MSP. After reading many bad reviews I though I would say that we had no bad experiences at all. we were given an exit row seat on our JFK-Paris flight. The food was normal airline food not great but I enjoyed the meals. I am 6 ft 2 and I had enough room on all my flights. The service was pleasant. The onboard entertainment was lacking on the 767 to Paris but I slept so it did not bother me.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-06;Manchester to Florida via Chicago. I had no real issue with the internal flights to Chicago but have a number of issues with the long haul flight to Chicago. The seats were in no way suitable very little leg room and I can imagine that it was very awkward if you didn't know the person sitting either side of you. The food wasn't too bad on the way out but if you suffered any dietary requirements it was tough. The flight ran out of certain drinks outbound and on the return journey. On the return journey we were sat at the back and we had to settle for what was left food wise as they'd run out of one of the options. The majority of the attendants were either rude sarcastic and had obviously missed the training session on customer service. Inflight entertainment was poor AA seem to be stuck in the dark ages with one tiny screen for every few seats. Overall I was very disappointed with the service which made a long flight seem even longer. I've definitely been spoilt with Virgin Atlantic who I will be using from now on.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-06;We always travel First class where available as we appreciate the extra details. We booked our family vacation first class from LAX to Maui on AA after a four day stop over in Disneyland. We had an early morning ride to the airport from Disneyland and check in went smoothly. The agent directed us to priority screening and The Admiral Lounge to relax in while waiting for our flight. Once we got to the lounge they tried to charge us $50 per person for lounge access. Normally with a first class ticket lounge access is part of that cost on all the other airlines we travel with. Not with American Airlines. They just chipped away at customer value by that one action for our family and I would recommend not using them if possible.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-06;Flew New York to Las Vegas - October 22nd flight #45. I´m really surprised that American is not considered Low Cost. First you must do your own check in and pay $25 for your first luggage. Second you have to paid extra if you want a comfortable seat. I paid $59 to stretch my legs and I choose the first row after business class. There was a division panel so in fact there wasn't much room. Third in 5 hours flight only 1 complimentary drink and if you want food have to pay for it. Fourth They promote the internet onboard but this is not free $4 for email and more if you want to surf the net. The flight boarded with 1 hour and half delay due to a problem with a luggage compartment door. Seated onboard for another hour and then half an hour waiting for our turn to take off after leaving the gate.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-06;"LHR-LAX. I bought the First Class fare to Las Vegas via LAX as it was quite good value for money and I knew I would be getting AAs new First Class product on the 777-300ER - it was certainly a better bet than BAs Club World on an ageing 747 - the only alternative. I avoided the AA Flagship lounge at LHR T3 as I had read so many bad reviews. The BA alternative was okay. The plane was brand new and the new seat was fine. There are only 8 seats in the AA 1st Class on this plane. Nothing spectacular. It was roomy good TV good seat controls and a neat feature was the rotation to face out of the window. Food was well just okay. Nothing very stylish. A trout timbale to start. A nice spicey butternut squash soup came next. Boring salad - seen better in M&S. Chicken main was - well okay. Had better in my local pub. FAs were friendly and called passengers by name. For the money it was acceptable. Certainly not worth $10-12000+ return which is often the regular list price to LAX. It lacks the ""class"" wow factor which should be obvious when you fly in first.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-06;"LHR-ORD return I have come to the conclusion that AA are probably the worst Airline I have flown with. First of all the planes wouldn't look out of place in a museum I haven't seen such an antiquated IFE system since the 1990's - suspended CRT monitors and they have the gall to charge nearly $6 a head for headphones. The food is awful with no choice to speak of - breakfast on both flights was a choice between omelette or scrambled egg since my daughter will not eat egg dishes on the outbound flight we asked if they could provide an alternative were curtly told we should have ordered a special diet meal. On the return flight we upset the crew by taking my daughters breakfast on board with us. The final meal - no choice just pizza. On both flights it was served so late that no sooner had we opened our cutlery than we were begin badgered by give up our trays as the crew needed to prepare for landing. During the outbound flight having slept for four hours and with no response to the call button I walked back to the galley to request a drink for myself and my family only to be told ""You have run us all ragged on this flight so we have closed up the galley and are resting so you'll have to wait for the meal"".";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-05;Used American on four flights SFO-LAX-MCO and TPA-MIA-LAX a mix of 738-800s 757 & A321. Despite losing a bag and a 2hr delay which where handled very well all flights were fine with nice crew seating and PTV on the A321. They don't serve food in economy on internal flights and I realise they are not SQ or CX but for the price I paid they are fine. I was able to use the lounge and book MCE seats because of my Oneworld status which made a little difference. My only complaint is compared to other Oneworld alliance members there lounges are miles away from either BA or CX.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-05;First time I flew American (I usually fly Delta) and I must say that overall I was impressed with the airline. On the way to NYC we departed on time and even got there 30 min early (never has happened to me before). The staff were helpful and the efficiency of the service was a huge plus to me. On the way back to Detroit we did board a bit late and sit on the runway for a while but again was a quick flight and really not much that I can complain about. Would recommend American Airlines.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-03;LAX to ORD via St. Louis one way in first. Both flights on time. Food was very good. Staff was very professional. All in all a very nice experience. Not much entertainment wise but these flights are not that long.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-03;San Diego to Miami - seating was so tight I couldn't read a magazine when the seat in front of me reclined. Extra charges for everything. A truly horrible experience but it was non-stop and they were punctual.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-11-03;My husband and I have just flown with AA from LHR to MIA and back and was very disappointed at the poor service and the rude and off hand attitude of the cabin staff in economy. As former Cabin crew myself I was astonished at the poor and lack of service on board. On the outbound flight there was no service for over 2.5 hrs as turbulence was expected. There was no attempt at any service during this time and the meal and drink were almost flung at us. I don't recall being offered a hot drink! No more service until the snack service which was an undercooked pizza. Pretty basic for a 9 hr day flight the return flight was no better. No drinks were served with breakfast as more turbulence was expected! There was no turbulence - in my opinion the crew didn't leave themselves enough time to carry out a full service. Considering the cost of the flight and the other ways airlines have of extracting money from pax such as priority boarding and choosing seats etc I expected better service and at least some courtesy! We felt that the service we received was unsatisfactory. I will not be recommending American Airlines after our disappointing experience.;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2014-10-31;Awful experience. The cabin crew are amongst the rudest least helpful people you are likely to come across in life. I was travelling with two small children 2years and 8months. Having spent the majority of the flight on my feet rocking my 8mth old to sleep she finally fell asleep. Breakfast arrived unfortunately I knocked the tray onto the floor. The member of cabin crew stepped over it ignoring it. When I apologised and asked for help to pick it up he curtly said he would get it later. The breakfast was strewn all over the floor in front of the toilet. I had a sleeping baby in my arms. When another passenger woke up half an hour later my fellow passenger was kind enough to pick the items up.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-31;My wife and I travelled overnight to Rome on AA on Oct. 1 from JFK. It was very disappointing. There were no in seat videos on the Boeing 767. The overhead screens continued to play movies until just before landing which prevented me form sleeping. The economy section food was uninspiring to say the least with stale dinner rolls and a wedge of cheese for dessert. This is our last international trip on AA.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-31;AA is an embarrassment to US hospitality and service. I frequently fly business class transatlantic - have you tried to get past a neighbor who is lying flat to reach the aisle? It's almost impossible as the seats are so badly positioned and designed. And what about the Business lounge H at Heathrow the food available and decor are awful compared to any other major world airline - yes including some US competitors. Finally I am tired of the grumpy geriatric flight attendants that seem to dominate the ranks. All US airlines have lost ground compared to their European peers but AA is down at the bottom of the pile.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-28;This was my first and last time with American Airlines. Booked with British Airways from Dublin to Orlando. Flight out was fine as it was with BA but return was with AA - as they are partners of BA I thought the service would be the same. How wrong I was - flight was 2.5 hours delayed which meant we missed our flight from Dublin to Glasgow. I had to pay £190 to rebook flights. We were only allowed 1 checked bag each but with BA we were allowed 2 each. The stewardesses only came round once with drinks service and you had to pay for spirits. Plane seemed old. No inflight entertainment system in the back of seat instead TVs that came down where everyone had to watch the same film. No leg room at all. Very narrow seats that were extremely uncomfortable. I never complain about anything and when I read the reviews before our flight I thought they were exaggerated but honestly it's the worst flight I have ever been on and I wouldn't fly with them again even if it was free.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-28;I flew from CDG to JFK on October 14th. It was the cheapest direct flight which was quite punctual. So the basis is 100% fulfilled. But the overhead compartment opened during take off and things fell down. It reopened during landing. When I left the plane I said it to the steward he did not ask me where it was located. Just something common. In addition to this half of the flight was in the dark because of an electric malfunction that prevented us calling for assistance. That is the visible part of the aircraft for the passenger. To fly in an old plane ok but it has to be nicely maintained.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-28;Always delays even when the plane is the first one out in the morning. Frequently when there are going to be weather delays the airline won't cancel so you can make alternative arrangement until you have sat all day waiting. I fly frequently and American always has some excuse for why they can't help their delays. Sick of this airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-22;"I was flying from Miami - Sao Paulo on AA929 on the 10th July 2014 on a 772ER in First. Having arrived from LAX 2 hours prior I was absolutely exhausted and was hoping to get some sleep on this leg. Boarding was smooth and the flight took off on time once the aircraft had reached cruising altitude and the seat belt sign was turned off I made my way to the galley and requested one of the two FA's (both were busy discussing their personal problems rather then attending to passengers) to turn down my bed I received a shocking impertinent response from her: ""So you want me to push a button for you"". Disgruntled and furious I prepared the bed myself and slept for the remainder of the flight. Around an hour before landing I was poked and woken up by the same rude flight attendant. At that point I expressed my frustration and told her she was not fit for purpose and shouldn't be working customer service orientated role. American Airlines has a good product in First (for a North American airline) I managed to sleep comfortably. however their poorly trained rude staff make it an unpleasant experience. Upon completing my flight I cancelled my return with AA and subsequently purchased a new flight with TAM which has a far superior product and customer service it's a shame they're suspending their first class on all routes from early next year.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-22;October 9 2014 AA 137 DFW to HKG. Flight departed Dallas pretty much on time. Once airborne hot paper towels were distributed following by drink service. Complimentary beers and wine. Shortly after drink service lunch was served followed by another round of drink service. Special vegetarian meal was provided. Meal consisted of rice and chick peas curry with a side salad with olive oil dressing and two pieces of melon as desert. Tiny quantity but tasted decent and edible. About 7 or 8 hours into the flight a mid flight snack was served with drinks. Three pieces of vegetarian wraps and a fruit salad was served. Less than two hours before landing in Hong Kong another meal was served. This time the meal was a cold pasta salad with two pieces of cantaloupe melon. Flight was about a little over 16 hours. Seats in Main Cabin Extra were fairly comfortable. Flight crew was professional but lack the grace of Asian carriers flight crew. No other amenities were provided like other Asian carriers such as toothbrush socks eye masks etc. However a refreshments self service counter was set up in the galley and juices and water were available through out the flight. IFE was surprisingly good with many new movies and TV shows available on demand. No flight deck announcement but flight crew provided information in English Cantonese and Mandarin. All in all a satisfactory flight with inexpensive fare compared to Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines but nothing special. Flight crew did not attempt to make passengers feel particularly welcome nor rude to passengers. Better than expected.;POSITIVE

american-airlines;2014-10-22;I recently flew from Chicago to Dublin Ireland on American Airlines - never again. The planes on both legs were filthy the toilets stank there was no individual IFE only shared screens on a 8.5 hour transatlantic flight the cabin crew were the rudest most unfriendly people I have ever met everybody sitting around me agreed. People had asked for blankets etc. but never got them. And to add insult to injury we were delayed 2.5 hours out of Dublin the crew didn't apologize and hit and the back so as to not have to deal with the passengers. If traveling from Chicago to Dublin I highly recommend either Aer Lingus or United. Both have good IFE their planes are clean and their staff are pleasant and accommodating. American Airlines in my opinion has gone downhill despite all their promises of improving their planes and services.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-20;October 6th 2014 MIA-STT. American Airlines is a low budget airline at best with premium airline prices. The service that American Airlines provide is on par with Spirit Airlines and Ryanair. Why pay so much to get there when someone else gets you there for less with same level of service.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-20;I have not flown for a long time but I must say I was very disappointed. I took a trip from Tampa Florida to Boston MA and twice fights were delayed. It's a shock to me that airlines charge so much to fly and then your experience is so poor. In this day and age delays should not be happening for this amount of time. I cannot consider them again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-20;I took a flight from Phoenix to Miami with Nassau Bahamas my final destination. I was extremely disappointed in the first class service. On a 3.5 hour flight we were offered one glass of either wine or water and twice a snack. Granted it was a red eye flight regardless the service should have at least offered a breakfast and coffee/tea. We landed at 7.30 Miami time which is long past morning coffee. This is the second time I took this flight and won't travel it again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-20;Flew from Manchester to New York and it was by far the worst airline I've ever flown with. Old tired plane with aisle screens - shocking when flying international. I couldn't even listen to the film as something had broken off inside where I was meant to plug in my earphones. The flight attendants response? 'Oh I'm not sure what I can do about that.' Disgusting customer service. The so called 'entertainment' consisted of 1 film then American programmes that I've never even heard of then it was turned off altogether 2 hours before we landed! The staff were very abrupt and just looked fed up - the food was hands down the worst I've ever had on a flight.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-12;This is the first time in about 15 years that I have flown AA. Never again! This airline doesn't care about customer service. Our flight out of DFW was delayed 4.5 hrs. Never was there an announcement. The gate changed 5 times. The flight being delayed was never addressed. DFW airport at AA is absolutely awful. While sitting for 5 hours and speaking to other passengers we found out the majority of flights were delayed for some reason or other. There were few if any gate representatives around. Nothing was explained to anyone.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-12;Round-trip Toronto to Dallas Sep 29 - 30. New A319 on both segments - aircraft clean and shiny. Paid for premium seat and well worth the $80 for the round trip. Lots of leg room exit row on return segment. AVOD and AC power available to all seats. Perhaps it's the new hardware making everyone happier - cabin crew was polite and friendly on both legs in contrast to several other AA flights in recent years.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-12;Traveled with AA MIA to SFO and return. Oct 1st and 5th. 738 on the first leg. 5.5 hr min flight one beverage service offered. Return flight 757 and 2 beverage services offered. Pay extra for better cabin seats pay to check a bag and hardly a smile. Really felt like cattle and not a pleasant experience. Waited for one hour to receive bags on the return arrival in Miami. It is truly a shame to see the deterioration of service in the industry and the total lack of customer care.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-12;Over crowded flight. They actually overbooked. Had 2 hour delay and another hour delay on the connecting flight. Had to literally run to the connecting gate due to such a late arrival the gates were very far apart. Plane was filthy. I don't think they clean them ever. Seats are small and uncomfortable. Can't even fully open the tray tables. I'm not a large person and I was unable to do it so I'm sure large people can't use them at all. However they do have tablets built into the seats but you can't do much on them unless you pay a high fee. Will not fly with American Airline again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-08;My Wife and I flew 28th Sept Vancouver to DFW to Orlando Business/First. Breakfast omelette cold sent back asked for a second warm scone instead! We were not the only pax to send the cold omelettes back. Admiral Club in DFW refused us entry. Never refused entry into Airline lounges before showing First/Business class tickets? My Priority Pas came to the rescue allowing me entry into a different lounge at DFW. The staff seemed very disinterested in what was going on and this includes a non existent cabin check prior to landing at Orlando. Will never waste my Dollars on First/Business on American domestic flights in the future. Nearly forgot - had to pay for wi-fi!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-08;"Original flight was from LGA to DFW. After flying in circles in the air for half an hour we finally re-routed to land in Little Rock Arkansas. We sat on the runway in the plane for at least two hours with no offerings of good or water even after the 4 hour flight. I understand completely this is weather related and only looking out for our safety however this was not handled well at all. When asking the stewardess for water- it's like it was a huge inconvenience. We finally deboard the plane in Arkansas and were told to wait around to see if the flight is officially cancelled - an hour later it was. Hotel rooms were not offered to be paid for not even a meal or anything at all. Everyone paid out of pocket and waited to de board the next morning. Back at the airport at 6am and we were told to use our old boarding passes and go directly to security- they refused us and made is wait back in the long American Airlines line to get a new boarding pass. My final destination was Austin which was also cancelled. They put me on a flight to Houston in first class which was unexpected. However I decided to just rent a car and drive to Austin from Dallas but I was told that there was no possible way to get my bag because it was listed as priority to Houston. Well our flight from Arkansas to Dallas was delayed an hour then the flight from Dallas to Houston was delayed another hour. First class wasn't anything special honestly more leg room and drinks served in glass instead of plastic. Finally arrive in Houston waiting at baggage claim and guess what - my bag isn't there. I was told it was on the next flight coming in from Dallas which infuriated me after I wanted to originally take my bag in Dallas as it was. Waited around the airport for another hour or so and finally get my bag with a big orange sticker on it saying ""priority"". Yeah right. Never will fly American again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-08;JFK-LAX First class. Good but not overwhelming as it should be. Seat on A321 is good but has some problems very hard to get out or in while even partly reclined. Food was mediocre in quality although presented nicely. Flight crew was wonderful but honestly the whole experience is either over priced or under done. Jet Blue Mint on my outbound was much better.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-05;Travelled for work to Santa Fe from Washington Dulles via Dallas Fort Worth. All the planes were on time and clean. No entertainment offered in MD80 old planes they should retire them. Everything on sale including headphones for $5 and you can take home after use. My company paid $1100 for this economy class ticket which is probably worth $300. Staff was all very friendly and offered whatever they can so acceptable behaviour there.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-05;Last night I flew from O'Hare to Dublin Ireland with American Airlines. I am a seasoned transatlantic traveler and have flown all airlines from North American to either Shannon or Dublin Ireland. On boarding the 767-200 aircraft I was astonished that there was no AVOD on the place only the large overhead screens which went out 15 years ago. Everybody sitting around me was annoyed as we all had to watch the same movies for the 7.5 hour flight. It is probably going to be the same on the 8.5 return flight - never again American Airlines.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-05;"AA104 JFK-LHR 20 Sept - Long queues at ""Priority"" Check-in at Kennedy thirty minute wait as agents struggled to help passengers from strike-bound Air France. TSA security a shambles (not the airlines fault). Admiral's Club a little crowded but a haven. Greeted by smilingly efficient desk staff. Bartender knew the drill two stiff Grey Goose and Tonics swiftly dispensed (but cheap and nasty plastic glasses?) Boarding was smooth and quick cabin crew a tad overwhelmed trying to stow overhead bins on this full to bursting flight. Main Cabin Extra (19D) seat would be well worth the small surcharge but complimentary to Ruby and above frequent flyers anyway. Great IFE OK food dished out promptly after take-off. Croissant juice and coffee before early Heathrow arrival. Bags already delivered by the time I got to the belt. From being the third world poor relation of the Oneworld Alliance American seem to be vastly improved. new aircraft and good service at an excellent price.

american-airlines;2014-10-05;Recently flew DUB-ORD - 22 year old 767 ORD-LAX-SFO 737's SFO-LAX-LHR 737 and new 777. Apart from the fact that I got there and back safely I must say what a disappointment the airline is in terms of inflight entertainment comfort staff and food/drinks. I fly regularly from the UK mainly East on EU/Asian airlines or within Europe and I now realise how spoilt we are here. When comparing AA to QR EK etc they just do not compare in any regard. The old 767 aircraft in a very tired state still had analogue buttons for their armrest music entertainment system and huge drop down crt displays. Food was awful and very poor quality on takeoff. The pre-landing snack a deep dish pizza was much better albeit on the greasy side. Domestic US services were on 737's - one with the new sky interior and 2 older interiors. All perfectly fine to get me from point A to B. Plenty of rather expensive food purchase options in the terminals and ability to bring food on board was good. I did not think much of the in- flight food menu for purchase - limited choice and not great quality it would seem. Nice touch for in-flight wi-fi although I didn't use it. The biggest disappointment and a real embarrassment was the supposed 'flagship American service' from LAX-LHR. Super cramped seating in 10 abreast layout in economy meant no elbow room whatsoever. Very poor in-flight entertainment system - hard to navigate difficult to find music titles plus generally limited selection. The catering was shockingly poor for dinner a chicken dish which was flavourless and served with a salad with grated cheese and dressing some crackers with cheese spread a biscuit for dessert and a cold and chewy roll. Breakfast was similarly disappointing and consisted of a yoghurt orange juice and a horrible leathery croissant served with jam and butter. A continental breakfast on a service between the states and the UK? Where is the sausage and eggs? Even Qatar give the above and a hot dish as their breakfast in better quality. The embarrassment really comes with the announcement at the start of the flight where we are introduced and welcomed to their 'flagship' service. It is laughable. On a plus note the drinks service was perfect. Crew were very hit and miss on all sectors. 767 is way above the 777 in terms of comfort and space. I would much rather have 9 abreast in a 777 or a 22 year old 767 then this flagship 777. Good USB/power options though - that's probably the only thing that they got right on AA136. I would go out of my way to avoid AA in future unless price is the only factor.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-05;AA #202 LAX/BOS in First Class Sept 28. On time both ends old first class. Crew worked very hard with drinks Samsung tablets and then lunch. Seemed a bit hectic but the galley space is close to seating. Tablets require a lot of the crew but are fine to use with good selection easy controls and good definition. Lunch was respectable and crew remained available throughout the flight for drink refills and distribution of snack before landing. A good experience with obvious efforts made to live up to advertised quality.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-05;Manchester to Las Vegas via Chicago. I currently live in Dubai and travel quite frequently using Emirates so I have probably been spoilt. The planes we flew on with American from the outside looked very modern however once we boarded things were very different. The interiors were outdated and looked like they had been in use since the 70's the interior was dull and the seats were like something out of a scrap yard mine was actually broken from were the trolleys had banged into it coming down the aisles. None of the economy seats had single televisions which I just could not believe for a long haul flight! Only business class are given portable tablets to watch the entertainment. The food was very poor and tasteless and the flight crew were bickering between themselves from take off to landing. I was extremely disappointed with this airline and I have vowed never to fly with them again please be warned as we spent a lot of money on this holiday only to be left disappointed by this carrier.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-01;Fight #1636 from Miami to Washington DC on Friday September 24 delayed for an hour due to the problem in Chicago then sat for 1.5 hrs inside the plane with no AC due to a maintenance issue. Typical of this airline - being treated like cattle.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-01;Travelled last week from Vancouver to Lima via Dallas on a paid business class fare. Entire experience was a huge disappointment the flight crews were indifferent seats were uncomfortable especially in the 757's from DFW to Lima. Did not get my pre ordered meal on the Lima - DFW return. As a business class passenger the Admirals Club at DFW was underwhelming. Had to pay for water. Will travel any other airline unless there is no other option. What a horrible product.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-01;Flights r/t SFO-JFK in the new A321 in C SFO-JFK and F on the return. First the F flight was simply the best domestic flight I have experienced in at least a decade. The new F seat is essentially the same as CX uses for long haul business a lie flat seat which is entirely private. The IFE screen is huge and the selection of movies is vast. Service was superb and attentive. The food was the best domestic food I have had for a decade (of course nothing will bring back the old days of caviar and meat carved on a trolley from the old days). The outbound C experience was excellent. Seat very comfortable and spacious. Service was good and meal acceptable. Should add it is a pleasure to fly on a brand new aircraft.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-10-01;I flew with American Airline from CDG to NYC and was outraged by the aircraft used a 757 with a very uncomfortable Biz Class old seats and basically an outdated aircraft. The inflight service was just OK and it is far from the standards used by American when flying to Asia. On the return trip it was a 767 and the experience was as awful as the way in. There is no comparable Biz Class in any Major European airlines American should rethink their product and services approach on these routes. Pathetic!;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2014-10-01;I flew on 23rd Sept.2014 on AA291 from Dublin to New York and after over 30 years flying with American I can say the airline is in deep trouble the staff obviously did not care about the passengers and if that is what happens in business class I feel sorry for economy class which is a cattle truck anyway. No water offered no wine offered no announcement about baggage pick-up at JFK. You had to ask for everything and the body language was why are you bothering us.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-22;I had to take my parents to the airport today to fly from SEA to JFK. We were on Alaskan Airlines flight powered by American Airlines. They were early to the airport for check-in at Alaska but got directed to go to American Airlines because for some reason we needed to check in there. The Alaskan Airlines employees were very cheerful and eager to help. Then when we showed up to American Airlines we were not even able to check-in even though they had 43 minutes before takeoff. They were 2 minutes late for automated check in. Then they had to wait in another line which gave them another flight which added an extra stop in Dallas. This changed their travel time from 5.5 hrs originally to a 9 hr journey. We had to accept even though we tried to plead them to get them on the original flight. The terrible thing is that they got to their standby gate 15 minutes earlier than the original flight was going to take off. And by no means are my parents fast people even with the normal lines in TSA. They could have made their original flight! I will never do third party travel sites again and the stupid confusion on flights was terrible.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-18;Flew this week Austin to Boston via DFW. Coach on the way up First on the return. Always impressed with the AUS- DFW flights even in coach they still serve the always full 124 pax a beverage on a 35 minute flight. MD-80 to DFW Main Cabin Extra as always comfortable and once again beverage service. B738 in Main Cabin Extra to Boston seats were fine the plane was clean the coach flight attendants on this route were somewhat disinterested. Only one beverage service and offer for food on a 4 hour flight. B757 with old interior on return. Didn't know any plans with these seats still existed. I did forget how large the seats are. Old seats but still comfortable. The two First Class flight attendants on this 4 hour leg were fantastic. Excellent service good red wine with dinner and a (4) course meal including a smoked salmon appetizer. Great food great service as always. Terminal C Admirals Club was a nice rest spot for our 90 minute lay over. MD-80 in First on the short 32 minute trip to Austin. Still a nice drink in their new glassware with Malano cookies out of the snack basket. AA still excels any other domestic carrier with regards to food offerings and beverage service especially in coach.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-18;Flew last month business class JFK-CDG. Flight delayed almost 4 hours announced 1 hour prior to departure. The attendant in the lounge told me we were lucky we had a plane. After boarding I was told the seat was not operational there was a barely visible sticker. But they did not know to what degree. The pilot had to look it up in his log. This took some 30 minutes. Verdict seat does not recline at all! They moved me to the back an arms reach from the coach bathroom. Each time someone went in and came out door slamming flash of light. There were 2 other much more desirable seats 4 AB it turned out those were for the staff. AA knows this are undesirable seats and it does not book them for their employees. The service on AA compared to other airlines is pitiful. With a few exceptions they treat you like they are doing you a favor. You never see a smile. The food most of the time is just plain bad. Due to the delay I almost missed my connection. After arriving to my final destination I found out that my luggage did not make it they found it 2 days later. Due to having to file paperwork for the missing luggage I missed my connection. AA is trying to blame it on the other airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-18;AA #2251 BOS/DFW on 9/8/2014 in first class. Flight left and landed on time. Seats comfortable though not the new lie flat. No seat AVOD. But the service the lunch were fine. Lots of refills for drinks updates from the flight deck. Connecting at DFW to Qantas to Sydney and transfer of luggage at DFW successful. A happy experience all in all.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-17;Miami - Los Angeles. Booked the tickets in advance so the cost of travelling first class for a near 6 hour trip was good value against the price charged for economy. Check in quick and we boarded on time with no delays. The crew were excellent attentive without being intrusive used our names when asking what we would like to drink and all made us all feel welcome on board. The food was very palatable. IFE was limited to drop down screens as the aircraft whilst scheduled to be one of the newer A321s in two class configuration was swapped out for an older 737 still wearing the old AA livery hence the 2 stars for IFE. Overall a very positive experience with AA on this flight.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-17;"I don't fly with American Airlines much anymore but I flew them to Seattle for Thanksgiving so flights were busy. I was in the very last row (row 32) of an MD-80 - it was noisy back there. My aunt was carrying our babies car seat which had food inside it it dropped into the first class aisle and one of the FA's glared at us and said ""you're dropping food!"" I mean really and she didn't even offer to help carry it? Fortunately a courteous passenger came and helped. Flight Attendant in coach was a lot nicer she even gave us some food for free after she saw how stressed we were. Then the return flight was cancelled because they could not get the hangar door open so American Airlines gave us some Hotel Vouchers. After getting back to the airport American Airlines gave us seats in First Class to make up for the bad night we had free food with larger seats and more legroom was ok but it was just not enough. We were tired and wanted to get home after landing back in Charlotte we had to deal with riding a packed bus to get back to the Long Term parking lot. This was the most tiring trip I have ever had for a domestic flight.";NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2014-09-17;This is my first and last time to fly AA. Booked my vacation 6 months in advanced for Sunday to Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Arrived on Sunday morning to find out AA switched our flight to their sister company US Airways. Went to US airways to check in and they had no record of the switch. Went back to AA and after a search located our reservation. However this took so long that we missed our flight and they didn't have anything else going out on that day. They rebooked us for Monday morning and tried fixing it with $200 voucher (my non refundable room was $300 plus missing a day of vacation). On Monday morning (5.15 am flight) we showed up and checked in and got on the plane it is now 6.15 am and we are still sitting at the gate because an exterior light is out. You would thing they could have fixed it overnight. Anyway no matter how the rest of the flight goes they can't change my mind about the low scores on this review.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-17;Great flight from JFK back to LA. Great service that was friendly and professional. The new airbus was polished and the cabin smart. I actually got four hours sleep on the new flatbed. Pre drinks meal service and the cookie and milk prior to landing was super nice and very much felt like service on there international routes when AA is on point. I have had nightmare crew on international flights like many reviewers have mentioned but AA really has made a substantial effort to compete on the NYC/LA route. Will fly them again and maybe try there first class product.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-17;I was scheduled to leave on Thursday at 3:05 PM (august 28 2014). I was called by American and notified that my flight was delayed out of San Diego so my connections would be missed. American then rescheduled me for a flight the following day at 8:30pm (over 29 hours after the departure date I had scheduled). I then called American and got them to put me on the original flight that was delayed and move my connecting flights. My plan was to just sleep in Chicago and fly from Chicago to London and London to Nice the following day. After taking the original delayed flight I got a hotel in Chicago for 200$ because the flight out the next day was not until 5:05pm. 5 hour delay on the flight from Chicago to London - over 2 hours were on-board sitting at the gate. I missed the connection from London to Nice and they put me on another flight which was also delayed 1 hour. I finally arrived in Nice over 24 hours later than the ticket I purchased. On the way back to San Diego everything went smoothly except my luggage did not make one of my connections. I finally got them to deliver the bag 56 hours after I landed.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-14;Flew with AA on our internal flights in Economy Plus due to one of our team being Gold with Qantas. That little extra leg room makes the difference. They were all short flights of no more than 2 hours so not getting feed was not an issue. Check in was good and service was friendly. We had a 2 hour delay in Miami due to a fuel delivery issue that was affecting most of the airport not just our flight. They keep us well informed. We had to terminate one of our through flights in Chicago on our way to St Louis due to one of our team becoming ill. We went straight to check-in to advise them that we would not be continuing our flight to St Louis and they were unable to stop our bags from going to St Louis. But they did everything they could to return our bags to us. They put them on the first flight back to Chicago and delivered them to our hotel later than night. Great service. Overall great flights and friendly service and excellent at returning our bags.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-14;LHR-MIA-GRU and GRU-JFK. Very quiet plane and cheery crew London to Miami Miami to Sao Paulo delayed about 90 minutes and crew a bit more grumpy. But they were sunny by comparison with the miserable team who took us up from GRU to JFK - good job there was superb IFE on a brand new plane (with disco lighting) to make up for it. I don't the cardigans and ties at half-mast helped. Having said that the AA/Oneworld staff at JFK did a great job in helping me transfer in about 30 minutes in order to catch a BA flight back to LHR.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-14;Usually fly oneworld carriers. Last flight on American was a complete disaster. Boarded on time and it took 2 hrs before take off no explanation given until we left the gate. Very old 757. They said maintenance. Still some FA appeared on board before departing. Once airborne no service on a 4hr flight to SJU from JFK only food for purchase. FA rude and not professional. Arrived very late. It took more than 45 min to get luggage.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-09;"SEA-DFW-MIA-MVD both ways flights. I had low expectations based on previous trips on this route with this airline. Even when the 767 airplanes they are using on the MIA-MVD route are old beaten down and the business class seating is at the minimum acceptable level the price matches what one can consider a ""budget trip"". However I could smell unpleasant odors from the bathrooms both ways from MVD while seating on row 3 in business class. This may not be acceptable to any business class passenger I must say. Also I verified that bathrooms were not cleaned by the staff. Perhaps some disinfecting towels would do passengers can clean the bathrooms by themselves and help with the smell. Anything but making your stomach revolt when having your dinner or breakfast in business class. I sincerely hope that American Airlines replace their aircraft on the MIA-MVD route as soon as possible with more suitable modern aircraft.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-06;AA51 LHR - DFW in new 773. American have hit the bullseye! Excellent service and food from the crew. AVOD system has more movies than you can look at!

american-airlines;2014-09-06;We flew from Manchester to New York at the end of August as a couple. We were surprised to be automatically allocated leg-room seats by an emergency exit at no extra cost. However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary. If this is how UK Manchester customers are treated (the same surely can't be true flying out of London!) then prices should reflect the poor service. Avoid AA if at all possible.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-06;I flew early September 14 from Kuala Lumpur to Hartford CT return. The quality was very uneven. From KL to Hartford it was okay. On the long parts (KL to Frankfurt Frankfurt to Charlotte) we were given two meals and a snack. The meals were okay but I was disappointed on the snack which was cookies and chocolate. Of course no menu as with Etihad and Qatar. I know I know I chose the airline because of the low price. I was even more disappointed on the trip back. On the flight from Chicago to London the seats and space were so tight we could barely move. The plane looked old and shabby. It still had those communal TV!. Come on! On a 7-hour flight? Those things were so outdated! The flight from Heathrow was much better. It's the new A380. Still food was not much better. By the way flights from KL to Europe and Europe to KL were operated by Malaysian Airlines but the ones from Europe to US and vice versa were by AA. Overall I wouldn't recommend taking AA flying from Asia to US.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-06;"Flt 986 St Thomas to Miami. ATC Delay in Miami (didn't tell us why but probably weather) not AA fault. Our aircraft left Miami for St Thomas returned due to medical emergency not AA fault. Aircraft arrived St Thomas and we departed 7.40pm (instead of 2.58pm) not AA fault. Arrived Miami and after 3 hours standing in line because in spite of knowing the flight was delayed four hours no one checked hotel room availability. We received meal vouchers for dinner ($12 and the restaurants were closed) voucher for hotel room (received at 2am waited 35 minutes for a van to a Holiday Inn had to be back at 5 to take advantage of the breakfast voucher $6 before the 7.14am flight to Dallas). Try to buy dinner for $12 or breakfast for $6 at Miami international. While we were in line no movement for over an hour because no one had checked room availability. Two attendants initially handling the entire rebooking for the flight. After over an hour another showed up at an adjacent gate. Shortly 'Denise' decided it was time for her to leave. She was 'supposed to leave twenty minutes ago"". Extremely poor planning overall. Poor accommodation after the fact. This is becoming the typical customer service quality for American and is really disappointing.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-01;"LAS-DFW-LGA-YUL. All flights were smooth and on time. The service the flight attendants and the seat comfort were fine nothing special. The second leg it was full and it was a hassle before take off with all the carry on bags the crew were asking passengers to collaborate by placing their smaller item under the front seat. This is what it happens when airlines charge for check in bags. You have to purchase the meal on board but the crew with a few smiles serves complimentary non alcoholic drinks. I found it weird when the crew were saying ""We know that you have a choice thank you for choosing us"" during their announcements. I chose American Airlines simply because it offered a lower price despite the long trip I had to do. Overall this airline is not amazing but it's slightly better than some low cost airlines. I would fly with them if they offer a low price.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-01;"Brand new 773 lovely looking aircraft clean interior but inferior product and service compared to alliance partner British Airways. 10 abreast seating is appalling for a long haul flight no comfort no headphones (this caught a lot of passengers out) cabin crew responded with ""the company doesn't give us any!"" - limited interaction with the passengers throughout flight. All in all very disappointing service with the ""new American"".";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-01;"After a 6 hour delay originally attributed to a broken air conditioning component estimated to take ""45 minutes"" to fix myself and several other passengers changed our tickets to another later flight to the same destination. After being boarded on that second aircraft we were informed that the ""maintenance log had been removed from the aircraft and not returned as expected"" so we would need to wait until it was located. Initially this appeared to be mere incompetence but swiftly came to seem like subterfuge. Fully an hour later we have just been told there is a panel on our aircraft that has to be replaced. This is supposed to take 1 hour. Meanwhile our original aircraft remains grounded without further explanation. As a passenger I am apprehensive flying on aircraft in such poor repair and moreover feel deceived repeatedly by gate agents and flight crew who are either misinformed themselves or deliberately trying to hide the sorry state of American's fleet. This will be my last flight on American were I not attempting to attend a family wedding I would deplane now.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-01;Flew from DFW to LHR on a 777-200 with my seven year old daughter. This flight was completely full but was acceptable for a long haul flight. The crew were very nice and helpful with my daughter and made her feel at home on her first transatlantic flight. The food and beverage was quite good for economy. Coming back to the USA was an entirely different story. Flew from DUB-Chicago on an old outdated 767-300 that smelt bad and looked very worn. The carpet was dirty and so was the seats. Additionally it was unacceptable to fly transatlantic with community video screens that appear to be running from a DVD setup with poor picture quality and sound. Again the crew was fantastic and treated my daughter extremely well and was very help with making arrangements to catch our next flight to Dallas even though we arrived over an hour late. Completing Customs and Immigration in Dublin saved us from missing out next flight. For the money paid the quality experience was unacceptable.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-01;Flight from London to Miami then Miami to La Paz. By far the most disappointing flight we have had. The cabin crew were unbelievably rude disinterested and unhelpful. We've had much better service with budget airlines. Thought it was ridiculous that people could reserve seats up to one year in advance. Our flights were booked by a tour company so we were unaware of this until a few days before and therefore left with disappointing seats on the way out to our honeymoon destination. Will not fly with American Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-09-01;"LHR to Miami return. Where to start. New logo - but old plane old staff old service. 'Turkey slider' in business class? Pre-formed mush. Surly badly dressed cabin crew. One of them was chewing gum and playing Candy Crush when I went to the bathroom! AA lounges in LHR awful - compare that to BA or Virgin! Even worse lounge in Miami - two vouchers for free drinks - for £4k? 13 year old 777 noisy  flat bed only goes down part way and worst of all - no laptop power adapters available ""We've stopped providing them""! Well you know what I've stopped using AA.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-28;FCO-ORD. ORD-CMH Flew an ancient plane with no IFE with one shared TV. Seats were uncomfortable. Food was better this time around although the service was bad. The crew missed out serving several rows multiple times on the flight although they kept the drinks coming very frequent. One of the crew members stopped the food service for close to 10 minutes to continue speaking to a passenger about her family.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-28;DFW-ABQ on Aug. 8 and return ABQ-DFW on Aug 15 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Flights nothing special but OK given the limitations on US domestic flights - obviously older planes but comfortable and cabins looked fresher than expected so obviously well maintained/renovated. Catering in First for both 100 minute flights during meal hours was a pack of pretzels and full bar service. White wine on the evening flight to ABQ was warm Chardonnay. FA's were friendly and efficient on the on the flight to ABQ and rather uninterested on the flight back to DFW. Delay of 45 minutes on the flight to ABQ but AA maintained that the flight will be on time until 15 minutes before the designated departure time although a delay was obvious as there was no plane at the gate so slightly irritating bad communication. Return flight eventless and on time. So nothing special but no major problems either. All in all a very average experience.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-26;Flight from Chicago to Cleveland cancelled for no reason. Put on standby 4 flights and 10 hours later with no help from gate attendants we fly into Cleveland. Flying out of Cleveland - flight cancelled night before no reason given. Re-booked on earlier flight. Arrive at airport and or course we're not on the manifest. Staff member very rude. Clearly no one who works for American likes it or it's customers either. Since American had cancelled 3 flights the day before they had nothing to do but put us on a United flight where we had to pay an extra $160 for baggage hat we would not have had to pay as our origin tickets were on Alaska Airlines. Never again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-26;American Airlines cancelled a flight with no warning claimed weather related but on looking at radar for this flight path that was fabricated. They made no effort to notify by email or cell phone (had both). I found out about the canceled flight when I arrived at the gate with my boarding pass. This resulted in a 15 hour drive. My advice - find a different airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-26;Flew out to Dallas from Heathrow in the new Boeing 777 which as a plane was okay and had good entertainment. They have a 343 layout which makes it cramped compared to a lot of other airlines I have flown with which have a 333 layout which feels more spacious. Some of the flight crew were quite unprofessional. One of them walking around with earphones in holding his iPod in his hand. Food was close to terrible. Returned on a Boeing 767 which had been painted on the outside to make it look modern but was like a museum on the inside. Old TV monitors hanging from the ceiling which showed one film on a nine hour flight which I couldn't watch as somebody had snapped off their headphone jack in my socket. Checked in really early but still sat apart. Food terrible again but flight crew a bit more professional this time. Have flown over 30 different airlines and I would say this airline is in the bottom 3.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-26;GRU-JFK and JFK-LHR: American Main Cabin Extra. Exit seat on both flights. Excellent price brand new planes. Greatly improved service food improved. There are better airlines for premium service nicer food but if you can make Platinum (50000 miles a year) then this is for me unbeatable. Free Main Cabin Extra Lounge Access double miles punctual flights on new planes.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-26;Recently flew this airline transatlantic route from Dublin to Chicago. The experience was awful! The plane itself was so outdated and old fashioned. It had the screens that dropped down from the ceiling! However on the outward bound flight the crew announced they were not working. So I had a seven hour flight with no film . The crew all wore different uniforms which made them look shabby and unprofessional. I am used to flying European airlines like BA and Aer Lingus whose planes all have the modern personal screens etc and whose cabin crew look smart and professional. My advice is stay well away from AA. I will never again use this airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-18;Was in Vegas headed to Dallas. The weather had been bad that morning in Dallas. Contacted my husband about the weather when it came to my flight home and the weather was clear. They had delayed our trip for 9 hours for no apparent reason and had failed to inform us of this. They had delays due to weather early that morning the flight coming from Dallas to Vegas was sitting at the airport and wouldn't load their passengers. Waited around for 9 hours only to find out by 10 pm that night that the flight was cancelled and it was too late to get a hotel. The staff in Vegas were very rude and pretentious. They didn't care about any of the passengers and were snappy when asked questions. I do not recommend this airline at all!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-18;This is a general review of American Airlines. Since 2000 I have flown with AA more than any other airline racking up nearly 1 million miles most in Economy some in Economy Plus and some in First Class. Maybe it's because I have so much experience that little things and small delays do not phase me but I have rarely had a problem so bad that I felt the need to contact AA customer service and I've never written a negative review. Yes it would be nice to get a snack with your beverage like Delta gives but I can bring my own package of cookies or peanuts if I want. And yes the MD-80 aircraft does not have inflight entertainment but they've had powerports on MD80s for a long time and then I've got a fully-charged laptop and smart phone to entertain me. Yes I've run into weather delays in Chicago during the winter which is why I connect through Dallas whenever possible. Yes it would be nice if they would upgrade some of their gate areas with more power plugs and offer their gate agents some sort of incentives to be a little nicer with regular passengers and not just us elite passengers. And yes sometimes they want more money for the same route as a competitor and those are the times I book with another carrier. But throughout my near-million miles and 14 years flying AA I still recommend the airline to my friends and family to get them anywhere in the world they need to go safely on time and for a reasonable cost.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-18;I am not picky about the airlines and used to travel by the cheapest deals available. This time I took AA. Flying American Airlines was the worst experience for me. The planes were mostly old and run down. They took 2 hrs to fix the bolt and screws while flying to San Diego on flight AA 49. The staff especially at Dallas boarding desk was rude and changed my seat without an apology. Not only that see was upfront rude. Each flight were at least an hour or 2 late. There are definitely better options and I would not fly this airline again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-18;"I was flying from Dublin to JFK NY on July 30 flight 291. I got the impression that serving the needs of the passengers was not a priority. I had reported to a flight attendant about some good amount of water sloshing around in the lavatory. It was slippery and the dirty liquid had got on my shoes and clothing. The flight attendant replied that she did not think the liquid was water and was not going to touch it. I do not understand why it could not have been mopped up. I think is was very inappropriate of the Airline to not train their flight attendants in mopping up unpleasant ""spills"" in the lavatories and providing them the sanitary means of doing so. This was upsetting to me to have to use lavatories with unsanitary conditions on an airline! The American Airline website makes it very difficult to send a complaint to. I think this is very important for them to see this and to correct it. I gave the airline poor ratings and do not plan to fly it again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-15;JFK-MXP-JFK. Both flights departed a few minutes early and arrived on time. Aircraft was an 'updated' 767-300ER with the new Biz Class and Main Cabin Extra where we were seated. Had the bulkhead seat both ways in this mini MCE cabin of 2 rows which made a difference. Service was ok food below average from JFK but much better from Milan. The only real downer is the lack of personal IFE or streaming IFE on this plane only main screen entertainment was available. Were lucky though to have a professional friendly and warm flight attendant from Milan.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-15;"Flew London Heathrow to JFK. Had transferred from Qatar from JNB-DOH-LHR. This was a bit like going from a fine Hotel (Qatar) to a cheap roadside motel (American). The American Business Class lounge/Admirals Club lounge at LHR beyond the new entrance is simply a dump. Old tired furniture no charm or ambience and an almost complete lack of any kind of decent food or snacks. I saw one tureen of dried up pasta and some pretzels and 2-3 halves of white bread sandwiches. Self serve beverages were somewhat limited with cheap brands of alcohol and ""spouts"" on the wine bottles-a really low class touch. Although the roughly half full business does have a state of the art flat bed seat with decent storage the cabin service was dismal. Pre departure beverages were served in flimsy plastic glasses. Cabin staff attitude throughout the flight was casual and usually indifferent. I slept until approx. 1.5 hours before landing missing the snack service. No a single member of the cabin crew offered to serve it to me later. The rear lavatories were devoid of any cosmetics the forward lavatories were stocked. Of course there were no flowers in the lavatories. Catering was adequate the menu was a tiny card like affair nothing like the elegant and extensive menu presented in a folder on Qatar. I am thoroughly convinced that flying on American or any US Airline on long distance flights is wasting money and accepting poor treatment and it makes more sense to choose non US airlines which offer their premium customers a much higher standard of service.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-13;ORD-MIA-GRU in Economy on July 28. Daylight flight from Miami to Sao Paulo - delayed 4 hours and that is where American failed its passengers. They boarded us and at the departure time they asked us to de-board as the plane has mechanical issues. Ok - fine. They say there is a plane at a gate that will take us to SP and they just need to service the plane. That was a lie - all the passengers got to the gate (and we had been told to take our pillows and blankets as the new plane wouldn't have them) and there was no plane. We sat around for 3 hours before a plane showed up from the hanger where 4 AA 777s sat the whole time. Finally board and take off - 8 hour flight and flight attendants were friendly. Seat comfort is awful - no leg room due to entertainment box at the window. Seat cushion is non-existent so luckly the extra pillow helped (we got on the plane and blankets and pillows were already there). Upon landing in Sao Paulo at 12:10am (4 hours late) we finally got an apology from the flight deck - until then they didn't say a thing about the delay. Come on American - have some respect for the people who pay your bills. I did get an email when I landed with an apology and 5000 AA miles - ok - that's nice. But I felt sorry for the many passengers who missed connecting flights at 12.10am there are no more flights until morning. I had a 2.5 hour drive to Santos and didn't get to my hotel until 3am. When AA does it well - its great. When they fail - its really bad.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-13;July 31 - CWB-POA-MIA-ORD. 767-300 from CWB to Miami in Business Class. Flight boarded and crew had just come in from Miami. They were awful - no one said hello or offered a drink until just before we departed 45 minutes late to Porto Alegre. I understand they are tired - AA needs to change crew at Curitiba and have a fresh crew all the way to MIA. Landed 30 min behind schedule at POA - had to exit the plane and they gave us new boarding passes and just waited in the gate area for boarding. Little cafe had snacks and flight was packed (in coach - 1/2 full in Biz) so gate area was busy. POA-MIA - excellent service! Flight attendants were so friendly and accommodating. Greeted you by name - were always in the cabin even though the flight leaves POA at 12:05am - with water and snacks. Slept well and had a quick breakfast before landing in Miami. Aborted landing due to some warning light in the cockpit but did a fly around and landed safely. A really nice flight once we got the new crew at POA. This is the type of service that makes AA stand out.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-13;JFK to LHR. AA's problems are no longer the fleet its old tired flight attendants that should be in bed rather than serving passengers paying up to $6000 for a business class seat with an attitude and a lack of respect that is simply unacceptable. Other passengers complained as well. Just impersonal and rude service on AA104. American needs to ground those FA's that are older and with attitude. Hire younger FA's that want to do their job rather than complaining to passengers about how the airlines have changed and how what we pay for the seats isn't worth it. After 33 years I'm not flying AA anymore. Ill go BA or anything other than an American carrier. They just honestly are awful now and I see no change due to them being union. Fly a foreign carrier. You'll see the difference.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-13;We flew from Shreveport LA to DFW. We then flew from Dallas to London. Neither plane left on time or got us there on time. We had people waiting in London. Same happened on the way back. On the way back we were shuttled to British Airways. Got to Dallas had a six hour layover. Because British Airways was late getting us to Dallas the layover was five hours. We sat in the airport in Dallas for 4.5 hours at the gate we were supposed to leave from. Twenty minutes before the plane was to leave from Dallas the gate was changed and we had to run to get to the new gate. I have come to the conclusion that American Airlines doesn't care at all about their customers. For the prices people are charged for tickets and fees you would think service would be better. Won't fly American again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-06;My husband and I recently flew American first class from SFO through DFW to SDF. This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Husband had an open-faced turkey/tomato/gruyere sandwich on fresh bread with a macadamia nut cookie. He also had a tumbler of red wine I had a diet Pepsi (they also offer Coke products). The flight attendant was also quite attentive and spoke with us by name. We felt very well taken care of.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-06;On my MIA-LHR leg I flew the 777-200 which is an awful configuration 2-3-2. What a lovely surprise on the way back to fly a 777-300 with a great configuration of 1-2-1. I was by the window great. Upgraded seat and a great crew to complement it. Wish AA would get rid of the 2-3-2 configuration in business - pathetic.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-06;July 31 we were on flight 3143 NAS to MIA. Flight was scheduled to take off at 605. We were on the runway on time when a passenger became ill. We returned to the terminal. They left her on board until a paramedic arrived to check her out. At this point she felt better and wanted to continue but had to wait until someone from headquarters arrived to determine if it was safe for her to stay on the flight. They took her off the plane then allowed her to return then took her off again. Every person on that plane had a connecting flight to catch. They then had to refuel the plane. We then got back on the runway then had to go back to check out a maintenance issue. We sat there another 30 minutes. Then we had to get off the plane while they worked on it. At 9.30 we boarded again then had to wait for a passenger who couldn't decide whether or not to continue. We finally left NAS at 10 pm. When we landed in MIA we had to go back through customs find our luggage then try to find someone from AA to help us all reschedule flights. No one from AA was available to help us until after 11 pm. They put us up overnight at a local hotel and rescheduled all our flights for the next day but it was a very poorly handled situation. I do not plan to use AA in the future. We have used other airlines many times and have had issues but never anything handled this poorly.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-06;I have been an airline passenger for the past 60 years. All types of planes to all types of destinations with all types of carriers. The golden years you might say when the flights were not only comfortable but fun and even riotous at times! The service food and drinks (especially the drinks) were an integral and indispensable part of the experience. It is sad to see what was once a wonderful and exciting experience reduced to the level of a bus ride and a damn uncomfortable bus ride at that! Flight AA121 Paris (CDG) to New York (JFK) July 2nd 2014 gave a glimmer of hope. The cabin crew were experienced co-ordinated pleasant and most helpful.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-06;We flew from LHR-JFK with AA101 in economy I also had low expectations about reading several reviews here on the website. Strangely enough it was a nice and overall experience with AA. B777-300 the cabin looks fresh and airy. The stewards and stewardesses ages were no lower than 50 years but the steward on duty on my aisle was very friendly. Food was ok we had a choice between chicken or pasta (no menu distributed) and an hour before arrival they distributed hot pizza and in between several rounds of drinks. Flight departed on time and arrived in JFK almost right on time. Overall experience was better than expected and I'll fly them again!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-03;"We paid for 6 business class tickets from Zurich via London to Dallas. Then 4 business class tickets from Los Angeles to London to Zurich. I've never seen a more consistent disgruntled group of employees in all of the years I've flown overseas. Where to begin? We chose American because of the ""New"" business class. We were given an old plane. My family is very low maintenance. We only ask for simple respect. We are mid flight and AA cancels our connection from Dallas to Grand Junction. 10 hours before we are to board. We don't get the notification until we reach our gate to fly to Grand Junction. No effort on AA part at all to help us. No hotel no car service. We make our own arrangements. This may seem small but by this point we are exhausted. Any help at all by AA would have been appreciated. Our return trip. I went for more water I was told they only had the large bottles. If I wanted more water I could bring my small empty water bottle up and refill it. Not how can I help you? Not can I bring the water to you? They stand there chatting while I try to refill my bottle.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-02;JFK-LAX return in F on the new A321 transcon product. American has really upped their game here. The hard product is outstanding in terms of privacy comfort and durability. Feels very exclusive and closer to the luxury that Asian and some European carriers are offering in long haul configurations. Outbound check-in was prompt although not very helpful with navigating the chaos that was security at JFK T8. Onboard service was exceedingly professional albeit not intrusive but that's the way I like it. Purser kept a watchful eye on the 10 pax in the cabin and was very prompt with drink refills or any other needs. Food was above expectations and in fact quite tasty. Could have a better champagne for first class (it is in fact not a real champagne but a domestic sparkling wine) but that's a first world problem of course. Pillow and blanket provided were of good quality could use a mattress pad for overnight flights. On the return check in at LAX Flagship was quick and friendly brought to the front of the security line which was nice. Can't comment on onboard service on the return because once we hit 10000 feet I put the seat into bed mode and slept a complete four and a half hours of solid sleep waking just before descent. This is a first for me in over 25 years of travel. For that reason alone I fully commend this product. It's a game changer for the NY-LA market.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-02;I recently flew with AA and US Airways from New York Boston and Washington DC. I cannot believe that American Airlines is part of the One World Alliance. When you look at the level of service you get from world class airlines like Qantas Cathay Pacific and LAN and then see the pathetic offering you get from AA I am dumbstruck. As a frequent Australian traveller I absolutely hate having to use AA anytime. Their Admirals Club lounges are truly pathetic - paying for food and pseudo-snacks like pretzels and plastic wrapped muffins. AA passengers who fly Qantas and use the Qantas Club lounges must be amazed. The service on AA is uniformly awful and rude. How can Americans put up with such an array of shocking airline companies. Now that AA have bought US Airways it will be doubly bad.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-08-02;My flight out of Chicago was delayed for hours and then cancelled at 1am. Understandable taking into consideration Chicago weather. However it was the customer service received during and after this that convinced me to end my days as an American Airlines flyer. I spent the next few hours on hold with customer service trying to get my flight rebooked. After 3.5 hours on hold I booked a flight for the following morning through the AA website to ensure that I would return home on time. The next morning unable once again to contact customer service I boarded the flight and made it home in time to return to work. Only after I finally contacted customer service did I learn that I had in fact been booked on a rescheduled flight. I searched my inbox spam and trash but had received no sort of email or notification of the rescheduling. If I had been informed of this flight or been able to contact customer service I could have foregone the cost of a second flight and avoided all of the frustrating cold emails that have taken place since.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-31;DFW to PDX - the service was terrible. First the price: it was $360 round-trip non-stop. While this may sound like a good deal it was not too long ago that American wanted $500 for the same trip. I could go to Europe one- way for that! The price drop is the only reason why I give them 2 out of 5 stars for value. If it weren't for that I would give them one-star without a second thought. Second the lines for baggage check were long. Apparently this airline does not realize that it's 2014: I was completely unable to pay my baggage fee online and there was no fast check-in option either. So I had to wait in line to do something I could have done online with other air carriers and only takes five minutes at most with other ones. Third the seats. They were harder than rocks with virtually no leg room with my messenger bag below the seat in front of me. It was virtually impossible to sleep or rest in my seat. When I got off the plane I was very sore. The flight attendants did not care about my experience and the check-in agents flat out ignored me at PDX. Lastly when I emailed American with a complaint about these issues I got the most sarcastic response I have ever got from a customer service representative. In conclusion I never plan on flying American again. I'd rather have a stop (or two!) than fly them.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-31;We had a really good flight with a very nice and obliging crew! Food was very good also the entertainment program and the seats. We will always fly with AA again!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-29;I will never fly AA again. The Miami staff were very rude and not accommodating at all. Flight was late leaving from Turks and Caicos and staff failed to announce the delay by half an hour. Therefore I missed my connecting flight in Miami to LGA. Miami Staff were not accommodating. I had an older aunt with me and I asked for a wheelchair twice it never came. AA staff had no sense of direction or didn't speak enough English - it was terrible! Never again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-29;LHR-JFK. I had low expectations due to reviews posted here. I was therefore happy to discover that the plane was new (and/or very clean) seats were comfortable flight attendants warm and friendly. The flight was full and the flight attendants graciously offered passengers the option to spread out so that we can be comfortable. Meals were hot and nicely prepared. IFE was varied and up to date WiFi available on board but not free. The pilot was very pleasant in his announcements that I didn't mind the delay in landing/parking due to the rains in NY. It seems AA is starting to up its game starting with international flights. Will most probably fly AA again in the future.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-29;"Let me start by saying I am a regular business flier and travel frequently although because of issues like the following complaint usually only fly AA as a last resort. On a recent trip from LGA to DFW AA forced me to gate- check my same standard 22in. carry-on bag which I take on every flight on every other airline. The bag clearly fit within the test box when I had to test it the first time going through the security checkpoint and similarly fit again when forced to test it at the gate but because the agent said I had to ""push"" it down to fit within the box it was too big and had to be checked. When I boarded the plane I was frustrated to see that the bag would have easily fit within the overhead compartment. Maybe AA has smaller jets with smaller overhear storage capacity than every other major airline. This was a big inconvenience and was easily avoidable and I will continue to avoid flying on AA whenever possible.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-29;The boarding passes we printed out at DFW Airport showed that the flight from DFW to TYR originally scheduled at 6pm was delayed to 8pm. We still went to the gate to see if the delay was changed. The monitor showed that the flight was delayed to 8pm. After we returned to the gate at 7pm we were told the flight left at 6.30. There was no more flights from DFW to TYR afterwards. The assistant checked us in for the 9.00 flight the next day. When we requested whether there was a voucher for a hotel we were told no. We called the customer service and were blamed for not listening to the announcements. We had to rent a car to return home and drove back to DFW next day to return the rental car. Each person was trying to shift the responsibility away to somebody else. If they made profits by charging passengers more and providing less service whats to celebrate?;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-29;Flight AA1018 DUS-LHR on 5/6/2014 onboard N936NN (B738). Flight was on time and smooth. Food and drinks to buy. Crew were typically American and not that friendly. Legroom was adequate but no more.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-27;Booked flights for the husband and I from BOS to MIA in October. Received an email changing our flight times and seats after we had purchased and selected. Threw us off the original time and put another flight number in its place. Had no reasonable explanation other than they are re-figuring their planes! Really messed up our departure for sure. The planes are so old and dirty. Couldn't even use the bathroom as it was filthy on our last flight. The attendants were miserable! TV monitors were from the dark ages not to mention the inside condition of the plane. It was falling apart from the inside. Could see the outer shell from my seat! Charge megabucks for low class experience.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-27;MIA-BOG-MIA. Both sectors were flown by very tired B752s with equally tired cabin crews. I have been flying these sectors along with other Latin routes with (Latin) American Airlines which bears little resemblance to AA mainline for some 25 years on the same aircraft type with the same take-it or leave-it cabin crew attitudes. Wifi and in-flight power is heavily advertised on these aircraft but were not available on either sector. Both aircraft and cabin crew are in need of a substantial refresh.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-27;From LA to Chicago on 22nd June on American Airlines. Perfect service from staff at the airport to FA's on the plane. I have read a lot of bad reviews on this website but can only say my husband and I found our flight more than we expected. Our luggage was delayed for about an hour but this was I believe only due to two planes arriving at the same time.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-27;Flight from Germany to Charlotte NC to Huntsville AL in 05/2014 was the worst flight experience. TV screen did not work staff was not concerned after numerous requests. The aircraft had a malfunction before takeoff in NC delaying us 3 hours on the taxiway. This caused a missed flight at the connection stop. American did not care whatsoever and we had to ask to get a meal voucher but that was all that was given. They would only put us on another American flight that left hours later putting us home in the middle of the night and needed to be at work the next morning. Worst airline ever. This review only covers about 65% of the issues experienced.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-27;LHR-MIA-LHR. It is some time since I have flown AA transatlantic after many years of having previously done so when both the hard and soft products were truly appalling. This choice came about as a result of the fare being two-thirds of the next best so difficult to ignore. Both sectors were by B77W equipment with the new Business Class configuration. This is a vast improvement. The cabin crew actually seemed to enjoy being there (almost) although the sole male cabin crew member in Business on the return flight was extremely obnoxious. Food was ok- ish and whilst I had chosen my entrees on-line for both sectors there was no record on board of any of my selections. The cabin crew told me that this on-line facility was a complete waste of time as it never worked. Overall AA was better than my recollection of many years before but hard product apart it continues to be still a long way behind the alternatives.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-22;Will never fly AA again. The experience at Dallas was terrible. Flight was late therefore missed flight. Boarded another flight but told to get off due to mechanical problem. Very little information on what to do next. Sent to four different gates. Treated like cattle. Never made it out that day and no guarantee to fly next day. Forced to go to a different airport and buy another ticket on Southwest. No apologies by AA personnel. Customer service was the worst I've experienced in over 50 years of traveling.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-22;I travelled American Airlines on Flight AA55 from Manchester UK to Chicago. This was an awful flight. The aircraft had no in seat entertainment the seats were old and uncomfortable the headrests hardly lifted above the seat so for a taller person the backrest sticks in your back. In addition the staff were at best terse at worst indifferent. I can only believe they are as fed up as I was being stuck on that aircraft. On the bright side it arrived on time overall however it was a prime example of a truly budget flight the only thing is I paid a lot of money for the flight. I only went this route because I needed to go to Chicago never again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-22;I purchased a flight with American Airline to fly from Miami to New Orleans on July 3-7. They changed my flight to US Air but didn't inform me until one week before flight. I paid for upgrade seats but it was not transferred over. Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful. When airlines join forces to become one company they should be operating as one not passing the buck and blame between each other.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-20;Took AA on a trip to Spain. En route two of my three flights were delayed almost causing me to miss a connection and my baggage was lost - not sure if by American or one of the affiliated carriers. The worst was yet to come however. My flight from Madrid to NYC was delayed by a couple hours and so I was rebooked for my connecting flight. I wish I'd insisted on catching it since it was delayed anyway because what transpired after was unbelievable. The rebooked flight to DC was eventually canceled. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours as maintenance repaired a broken chair then a door and then we lost our slot in the queue and had to wait awhile and then my home airport suspended flights coming and going due to weather. Finally the pilot took us back to the gate and told us our flight was canceled. 4 hours on the tarmac that day. Service to rebook flights was slow and some agents were a bit snippy. Slept at the gate overnight for my early flight the next morning. Had a bad feeling when I saw people arriving through the same gate 15 minutes prior to our scheduled boarding time. Sure enough we sat there for well over an hour as the tyre on the plane was being changed and then the flight was canceled. Exasperated I asked for a flight out of LaGuardia instead and although it was delayed on the runway I eventually got home after four bookings from NYC to DC. Very tight seat arrangement on the planes flying back (because they were older). Food wasn't bad and service on all the planes was overall pretty good. Service at the gate ranged from very solicitous to brusque. The airline seems to schedule flights too close together. On top of that the planes on my return trip were all old and shoddy hence the delays. So I ended up being booked for eight flights round trip when I was originally scheduled for just five. Seven of eight were delayed and two of those led to cancellations. American didn't do much to compensate me for the inconvenience either. I will never fly AA again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-17;Flew from LAX to JFK on AA292 in First Class 14th July. A very good experience on a brand new plane an A321. The seat makes the flight as it converts to a fully lie flat bed and I was able to get a few hours of sleep after having a nice hot breakfast. Good inflight entertainment amenity kit and a great cabin crew who seemed happy to be there. Well done AA!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-17;ORD-SEA first class. Standard first class seats. Nothing special but comfortable. Lunch was surprisingly good. Glad we pre-selected the beef dish. Decent selection of beer and wine. Still don't like the fact that buying a domestic first class ticket doesn't get us into the airline's airline's club but this is standard at least among U.S. airlines.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-17;HKG-DFW. Check-in: no online check-in for some reason had to do it at the airport. Good no problem. Boarding: for all US-bound flights they had to search all our hand-carry bags for water/liquids and they do it in the middle of the bridge where the air isn't moving very well and warm. I don't understand why can't they do it right before scanning the boarding pass. The bridge area is small not a smart idea at all. I feel bad for those in a long line for the economy class. In-flight: Food/meals are very good no complaints there. The seat is excellent with lie-flat bed and big screen monitor. One problem there were several movies/TV shows that are shown available but couldn't get to it. Other than that slept well and services were fine.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-17;"Just flew on Sunday 7/13 on AA's new 777-300 International configuration in business class. I have to say that it was the very first time I have felt that a US carrier competed effectively with front rank international carriers. The seat was excellent. The overall quality of the seat was superior given the amenities screen etc. Just the slightest bit less comfortable than BA's flat seat but not a huge different. The overall seat was superior to anyone else's business class I have been on. The food and beverage service was excellent. Appetizing decent portions well served and proper temperature. Inflight entertainment options are excellent. Beats the angled ""lie flat"" seat on the 767's and older triple 7's. You got it right this time. Even the crew was not as grouchy as AA flight crews have become. Actually I was very pleased.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-15;Had a 6 part trip this month on AA. Every leg had issues. Mechanical problems abound due to the age of the fleet. Arrived at JFK for the vacation portion of this trip and was told at the first class check in that our aircraft was removed from service and we would be 6 hours delayed departing. We missed our first day of vacation and a party because of this. Bottom line you can't rely on this company to get you where you are going in any reliable way. Also have issues with their website frequently down lack of communication with flight delays also.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-15;Just flew 4 domestic sectors LAX-DFW-OMA and DSM-DFW-LAX. Ex LAX boarded on time but then due to weather in DFW were delayed for roughly 2 hours. Informed of delay by Captain and given updates. Once underway beverage service given inflight video shown. Overnight in DFW then to OMA next day. Flight delayed due to mechanical issues. Passengers allowed off plane after first hour cabin crew offered juice and water then granola bars. Flight cancelled after 4 hours. $12 refreshment vouchers given. Replacement aircraft and eventually got away about 5.5 hours late. Whilst this was an inconvenience I believe the staff acted properly keeping passengers informed and making alternate arrangements. Return flight I requested baggage to be checked through to SYD which took some time to organise due to booking problems caused by the earlier delay when I had been taken off the delayed flights but then reinstated. Only complaint was during this time our pre-assigned seats were given away and we were given seats at the back of the aircraft without the additional leg room. All things considered I was happier to have bags checked through and less legroom. I have been critical of AA in the past but thus trip they receive full marks.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-13;I had not flown AA for a few years and now I know why. AA employees sat in first class on a very early flight from TPA-MIA and spoke loudly to one another while the other first class passengers tried to sleep. Had a 7.40pm flight from MIA-TPA but paid a $75 plane change fee to take the 5.50pm flight. No problem there except for the fact that the plane flight 986 from STT-MIA had an alarm mishap and they had to call a maintenance personnel from off-site. He was very late so therefore missed the earlier connection at 5.50pm from MIA-TPA and took my original flight at 7.40pm-no compensation returned for their error. Other members in my party had first class on the 5.50pm flight and did not receive it when we were all booked on the 7.40pm flight. They did attempt to put us all together but placed us in the exit row with two children traveling under the age of 15. Therefore the kids had to sit in other areas in the plane and were scared to sit alone. Upon a later arrival to TPA at 8.40pm AA/US AIR misplaced our luggage and was it was all still sitting in Miami with Priority tags on them. So much for priority as they turned up a day and a half later.;NEGATIVE

No problem there except for the fact that the plane flight 986 from STT-MIA had an alarm mishap and they had to call a maintenance personnel from off-site. He was very late so therefore missed the earlier connection at 5.50pm from MIA-TPA and took my original flight at 7.40pm-no compensation returned for their error. Other members in my party had first class on the 5.50pm flight and did not receive it when we were all booked on the 7.40pm flight. They did attempt to put us all together but placed us in the exit row with two children traveling under the age of 15. Therefore the kids had to sit in other areas in the plane and were scared to sit alone. Upon a later arrival to TPA at 8.40pm AA/US AIR misplaced our luggage and was it was all still sitting in Miami with Priority tags on them. So much for priority as they turned up a day and a half later.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-08;ORD-JFK/LGA-ORD - July 2-5. I keep seeing a huge increase in great attitudes from flight attendants on AA flights. Very personable and fun on both flights. Departed ORD on-time and landed at JFK early - but taxied around JFK for 30 minutes before getting to our gate. Dinner served was pre-ordered on aa.com and the chicken was very tasty. Return to ORD from LGA - plane was only 60% full and the three flight attendants (DCA-based) were having a great time with everyone. Lots of talking laughing with passengers and very personable. Good dinner served and landed 40 minutes early into ORD. I see a lot of negative reports for AA but I wonder if people are just expecting too much or are exaggerating their issues. Keep up the good work AA!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-08;One month travel itinerary June 10 - July 8. Point here is not as much about inconvenience as how situations are handled. 4 flights cancelled. One due to weather. Paid upgrades are not refunded if flights cancelled per AA reservations. After 3.5 hour wait little or no information given to waiting passengers in cancellation of first leg OGG-LAX. Restaurant employees saw flight crew leave airport. AA would only help passengers with connections. The rest of us scrambled for flights. Locating luggage was a whole other mishap. 2.5 hr flight from QRO-DFW turned into a 10 hour flight touching down in 2 cities to refuel. Water was being rationed. Children first. No food. No offers from ground crews for additional water or even peanuts. No help with connecting flights. No enough cots in airport Terribly mishandled. Connecting flight missed but cancelled anyway. MCI-OGG delayed 4 hours. Equipment not available. Automated message via phone at 2.30 am for 7.30 am flight. Was auto rebooked on flight out a day later. Called and obtained same day departure. Hoping I get out. Remember when flying used to be fun and airlines treated us with courtesy? Note: Have flown all other US carriers AA is cheaper but savings offset by delay costs incurred other problems and poor treatment.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-08;"I flew from Ontario CA to Indianapolis IN by way of Dallas TX (round-trip). All 4 planes were MD-80's - I probably don't need to say much more. These planes should have been taken out of service 10 years ago. I was flying them in the early 90's from ORD to LAX they needed to be retired back then. All 4 flights were delayed because of mechanical problems (ranging from inoperative toilets to loose electrical panels). All 4 planes were filthy - not just the rest rooms and aisles - but the seats windows and tray tables were disgusting. All 4 flights were full - so as we sat on the planes waiting for the ""maintenance issues"" to be resolved we roasted. Given that I had a similar experience on a trip from Palm Springs to Cleveland (round trip 4 flight segments) in April on American I should have known better. But as a ""loyal rewards member"" I booked this last flight on American too - hoping for better equipment and on time service. At this point I don't even expect any aspect of comfort on American flights - I just want a safe plane that lands reasonably on time. Given the last 8 flights that I flew on American planes in the last 90 days I'm not even certain that the old MD-80's are safe anymore. When 6 out of 8 of my flights were delayed for mechanical or maintenance issues I begin to wonder I'm going to start building my miles on United. I'm done with American. P.S. - during the last 20 years I have been ""Gold"" ""Platinum"" and in the ""Concierge Key"" program - so I have witnessed the decline of this airline's quality and on- time performance first-hand.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-08;Flight #7943 from Honolulu to Los Angeles April 25 2014. This airline is terrible. The only reason to choose this airline is that they have so many flights to so many locations. But it is as if they don't like to be in flight service. Both my husband and I have been regular flight passengers for most of our adult lives for business and pleasure. Over the years AA has not improved on any level of their service. Since going online for booking we have yet to have reservation that isn't botched in some way. I am sitting on AA plane as I write this as we wait after flying 5.5 hours for a gate to become available. Though this may be an airport error the connections between flights is so short that many passengers are in threat of missing there next flight. We almost missed our connecting to this flight because only 30 minutes was allotted between flights. I would gladly pay more for better service and have but AA has only increased its prices but not improved the quality of service.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-08;"Pensacola to San Francisco. After paying full fare for a toddler in a seat my pregnant daughter was treated so inconsiderately by American Airlines staff that none of us will ever fly with this airline again. No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection. There is no compassion from this airline!";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-06;Paris to Boston on an old and uncomfortable 757. The worst international business class seat I've ever had. Did anyone from American try sitting in this seat before they selected it? Small personal video screen with terrible resolution and limited choice of films. Food was inedible. The only good about this flight was the crew - friendly and hard working. Luggage took 40 minutes to unload. Overall a terrible experience.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-06;We will never fly with this airline again. Flight out of Moline Il was delayed for an hour because the airplane wasn't there. We finally get a plane and find out from the flight attendant the delay was caused because there was no ramp at their last stop. The pilots did an awesome job getting us to Dallas on time. But then we sat for over an hour waiting to get to a gate. By this time everyone's connecting flights should have left. But we run across the Dallas airport and find out our connecting flight is delayed as well. Seems we didn't have a crew. What a joke. Never again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-06;"I recently flew from Miami to London. Sat in the economy class. Seat was extremely narrow designed for very slim person. I am 185lbs and 5'11"". For me the seat was very uncomfortable. If you are a large person recommend to buy 2 seats or avoid flying economy. The cabin was very claustrophobic. There was a big wall in front. The quality and the quantity of the food was pathetic. Inedible unless you were real hungry. This airline lowered their standards tremendously. I used 50000 points and paid $68 for this one way flight. In monetary terms approx $700. If the airlines do not stop abusing their passenger I personally will give up long distance flying.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-06;We recently took our family to Maui to celebrate our 48th anniversary. My husband is in his 70's as I am and he has Parkinson's disease. I have recently had a knee replacement so we rented a hotel for the park and fly program as did our daughter's family for a total of $475 so there would be no chance of us being late for our plane which was to leave at 10.35 am. We arrived early as were told to do. Eventually we found that there was a delay of at least 30 minutes. The delay continued to be extended and ended up being a 9 hour wait. AA reps told us there was nothing they could do. The seats are firm plastic with no head rest or place to lean against the wall. We were given a lunch voucher which we used but were never offered a dinner voucher. We became more and more frustrated as time progressed. We finally left for a long flight to Maui with a crew who were unhappy to called out on Father's Day on an unexpected flight. Their attitude reflected that. We were not given anything to compensate for all our problems no free drinks no food. Nothing. We got to our hotel at 3.30 am. On our trip home we were held up because someone had thrown up in the seat but it wasn't cleaned up by the cleaning crew. There was vomit on the seats and in the buckle making it necessary to take off all seat covering and taking out and putting in all new seatbelt apparatus. To top this all off we are AA frequent flyers!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-06;What a horrible product AA offers in the back of the plane for longer flights. I flew from Manaus to Miami overnight and could not get comfortable in the nasty thin under padded seats. The meal service was a soggy ham sandwich and a glutinous dessert while the entertainment was provided by screens that dropped down from the ceilings. Even small Air Canada planes have seat back TVs but American's 737s do not and this on a 5-hour flight. When they dimmed the cabin lights the screens kept playing the film so good luck trying to get any sleep with the flashing lights in your eyes. Awful just awful. It is a throwback to the 1990s.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-01;I recently booked a 9.30am trip to Amarillo through American Airlines (booked it 2 months in advance). The morning of the flight at about 6.30am (while I was headed to the airport) I was called by American Airlines and it was an automated voice recording telling me that my flight had been cancelled and they automatically put me on a 6.30pm flight that night. I had no option to talk to anyone or hear a reasoning on the scenario that was taking place. I had to call back and go through various automated conversations until I finally reached someone. After explaining the situation (and no sympathy was shown) I realized the person could not help me and did not desire to help me. Little did she know I had major wedding events to get to at my destination (hints why I booked an early flight in the first place). I ended up having to book another flight through Southwest Airlines last minute (costing me a fortune) just to make it to the city in time. It was an all around awful experience dealing with an impersonal system that left me without answers paying a fortune and still arriving later than I planned. I will never again try to fly American Airlines.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-07-01;On our return flight from Orlando to DFW we arrived early to the massive lines at security. Got through and sat down for an early dinner flight delayed. Took our time then another notice flight delayed again. Finally left dinner and walked around got to out terminal flight delayed again. So our 7pm take off was now leaving at 9pm. Sat down and watched TV. Then some people started standing up and getting upset flight now delayed until 11.45pm. Our plane arrived but had to wait on a crew to fly us. Finally got on the plane after midnight and waited another hour on the plane. We were told we might not have enough fuel. Really? The plane had been there at the airport for 3 hours and no one checked to refuel it? Got back to DFW at 2.30am. Only one baggage person there at that time and several bags were missing. 30 minutes waiting to get our bag that came in at an early flight. So 8 hours in the airport and all the explanation we got was it was DFW's fault. Never again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-30;I was on a round trip Miami to Buenos Aires in business class. I read reviews about the service and aircraft (767-300) being substandard. However I found the seats to be reasonably comfortable and the service by the Buenos Aires based crew was very nice.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-25;Narita - LAX June 25 First Class. A totally acceptable experience except for boarding and off loading. See my previous review for service comments. Boarding for a First class really needs an upgrade first class passengers deserve more. LAX arrival was unacceptable. Remote gate (ok that happens) but first class passengers were herded onto a packed bus for the ride to terminal. Come on not even a special bus for first and business pax? Not a way to get or keep premium passengers.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-23;June 15-19 supposed to depart from Knoxville to Dallas to Las Vegas but were made to drive from Knoxville to Nashville. Route ended up being Nashville to Dallas to Las Vegas and vice versa. Our flight was changed several times by the airline before departure date. On the date of departure we received an automated phone call 3 hours before take off notifying us that our plane was delayed 4 hours. This interfered with our connecting flight and there was not another flight that would have us reaching our destination until the next day. I contacted the airline immediately and they confirmed that if they re-routed us we could reach our destination. We agreed to this and proceeded to the airport. Upon arrival we were unable to check in. An hour later it was discovered that when re-routing us the person had neglected to issue us a ticket and now our flight was over booked. Our only option was to drive 2.5 hours to another airport catch a flight there and then have 15 minutes between connecting flights that we were to try and get to the gate and board in time. Somehow we managed to make it and made it to our destination. On our return trip we again couldn't check in and had to see an attendant. Everyone we encountered was extremely rude and hateful. I will never fly American Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-23;If you're looking for a company that will fly you in the least comfort at the highest price then look no further – you found it. It is inconceivable that American Airlines are still flying old planes with no individual entertainment systems on their transatlantic crossing and charging more than anyone else for the privilege. They didn't even show the film they advertised. We only flew from JFK to Buffalo (with a rival company) a flight of just over an hour and they had individual entertainment screens. To add insult to injury AA ran an ad telling us all how they are adding a new plane every week to their fleet! All I can say is watch out AA when Thomson starts flying the Dreamliner from Manchester to JFK in May 2015 I do not predict a very prosperous future for them.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-20;LHR-MIA 11 June 777-300ER in Main Cabin Extra. I read a lot of complaints about American but it is an American airline serving American tastes. It has no desire to compete with the significantly better Asian and Mid East airlines and it would seem quite happy with its 3-star rating. So don't expect too much! Main cabin extra is excellent and as my husband is a permanent gold card holder we were able to select these at no extra cost. The seats are wider and very comfortable. The extra legroom is a bonus. Everything else is as in economy. The IFE on the -300 is very swish with a large screen and huge content a marked improvement over the -200 and the 767. I've always found that if you are nice to the staff they are nice in return and this was the case on this flight. The service was prompt and efficient the food acceptable and staff were present throughout the flight. Take off and landing were about on time. Be nice keep your expectations reasonable and its ok.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-20;I booked a flight from LAX to Raleigh-Durham NC. 24 hours before the flight I went on the AA web site to 'Check- in' and obtain my 'Boarding Pass'. When I selected the option to check-in I was asked if I wanted to select a seat. I elected yes and was presented which several options for only 'Paid Seats' at $86/per seat. Thinking there were no other options I selected a seat and paid the $86 for both the departing and return trips. After making and paying $172 for seats the web site asked if I wanted my boarding pass. I said yes and I was offered the option for seat selections that required no extra fee. Feeling set-up wondering why I was not offered options for all available seats from the beginning I called the AA Customer service group and the agent informed me that they could not do anything about changing my seat to one that did not require an extra fee. I then wrote them to ask why I was lead into believing I could only purchase a seat when free seats were available they simply said 'you made the decision to purchase the seat and therefore there is nothing that can do'. After this frustrating experience on the outbound flight I requested a 'bloody mary mix' just after the stewardess handed one to the stewardess covering the first class group. I was informed that they no longer had any more. Things on the return flight were equally as bad. I was unable to print a boarding pass - web message said my reservation had been cancelled. When I attempted to call the customer service group at 11.00 pm EDT the auto attendant informed me that wait time to talk with an agent was 35 minutes. Needless to say after these experiences I will never fly this airline again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-20;MIA-LHR 16 June 777-200. Used miles to upgrade from economy. Call centre staff very helpful with this. Our flight didn't have enough upgrades available for both of us but she checked the next flight and found two. We paid a small extra charge to change flights in addition to the usual miles and co-pay but well worth it. We were originally returning on the -300 so a bit disappointed. The 2-3-2 configuration is now old hat as are the seats. American made a big mistake not going for fully flat bed seats when they bought the -200 and the angle flat seats are very out of date. Having said that they were very comfortable with huge legroom. The angle is not as bad as some I've been on though and I managed several hours sleep overnight. Lots of space and a bit of room for your bits and pieces. Service was rushed on takeoff which I assume was because the flight left at 21.20 and they wanted to allow everyone to sleep as soon as possible. Lights were out before we asked for coffee and cognac but staff willing to continue serving us as long as were wanted. Staff were visible all night as far as I could see. Be nice to the staff and they will usually be nice to you. Almost always works as it did on this flight. Food was only average certainly not what I expect for business class - grossly overcooked steak destroyed broccoli thing and something else I couldn't identify. Breakfast was a lovely omelette but it came with another grossly overcooked and dry bit of steak. It was all well presented and served however with good crockery flatware and glass wine glasses. Interesting that they did trolley service rather than tray service I have previously had on American. IFE on the -200 is dated with a reasonable screen size but limited selection of movies. It broke down at the beginning of the flight and it took a very long reboot to get it going. Certainly not up to the standard on the -300. Bose noise-reducing headphones a great idea but they are collected an hour before landing. The map feature showing flight progress etc didn't work for the entire flight. American is not trying to be one of the significantly better Asian or Mid East airlines so don't expect it to be. Keep expectations reasonable and you will likely enjoy the flight. I did.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-17;LAX-LHR. Business check-in at American's terminal at LAX is a joke. 1 person to check in everyone while 2 customer service agents hang around telling us 'they're going as fast as they can'. Security was in a tiny airless room - I couldn't quite believe this was the entrance to the terminal. Once through we passed the main spacious security check-in - it was closed. At the Admirals Club things started to look up: it's large with friendly bartenders and table service for drinks. Surprised to be restricted to 2 drinks coupons though. I'm guessing it's because there are domestic passengers in the lounge too. The plane was at a remote stand so we had to take a bus out to it - this surprises me as you would have thought that LAX-LHR was a premium route and American would want to encourage passengers. On board the cabin in business class on the 777-300 is exceptional - probably best across the Atlantic. Huge seats comfy flat bed great IFE plenty of drinks and ok food. Cabin crew friendly enough. Easy to sleep on this plane. There was a delay due to a sick passenger on the incoming flight and then a minor maintenance issue - all the movies were on so we drank and watched films. Breakfast was plentiful and really fresh. Sorry to get off at LHR!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-13;We have just completed a round trip from the UK to USA two transatlantic flights and three internal flights. The first from London to Dallas was characterised by dreadful food (lunch being served immediately after an early morning take-off!) with very unfriendly and ungracious staff. The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the 'pontoon bridge' attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful tho' with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. No staff would tell us what was going on the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible. Staff were not only surly but extremely rude. In all instances the planes were old shabby and dirty with worn through upholstery and carpets defective lavatories inflight entertainment was broken reading lights did not work fresh air vents that would not open or close and the worst cabin staff I have experienced.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-13;June 12 AA169 LAX-NRT F Class. Nowadays one has quite high expectations for International First Class while adequate American met none of those expectations. On all levels it met international business class standards and no more. Cabin crew was friendly but not very visible between meals. Better off in business on JAL United Singapore or even Delta. Quite a let down.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-13;June 11 2014 flight 1322 Liberia Costa Rica to MIA. Worst experience ever! On our return aircraft had an engine problem delayed flight for 4 hours missed connecting flight in MIA to NYC because of this issue. Arrived at MIA at 12am and next flight was at 6am upon leaving same engine issue flight delayed 2 more hours. On top of the fact that their aircraft's are not inspected they offer no food not even a bag of chips and there's no wifi even though they say they provide it. I travel twice every year will never fly with them again!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-12;I just completed a multi city international round trip with American. 2 international flights and 3 domestic. So the international (from South America to Miami) was an overnight flight. The plane was old and the ceiling TVs stayed on all night. No sleep. All of my domestic flights were either delayed re-routed or cancelled. The first from Tampa to DFW was cancelled due to no oxygen. To top it off at my final destination back in South America one bag was delayed (hopefully not lost) as it was accidentally put on a LAN flight to Lima. 5 days later I am still waiting for it.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-12;"I flew from Manchester Airport to JFK in economy class. From the start the aircraft was very dated and did not smell particularly clean. The food was dull unappetising and almost thrown at you by the staff drinks were not offered except with the meal I had to beg a member of staff for a bottle of water on the journey. The IFE was very poor the TV was attached to the ceiling above the aisle so from my window seat I couldn't see the full screen so didn't get any IFE. On the return journey the same 4 episodes of ""Salvage Hunters"" was shown on a loop so repeated 3 times during the 7 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable and very cramped on the return flight the passenger in front had his seat back which meant for a very claustrophobic journey. The most startling aspect to flying with American Airlines was the rudeness of the staff! I went to the toilet and an exiting a member of staff had started serving lunch she kept shouting at me to not stand close to her (which I was not) and in the end marched me to my seat and demanded I ""sit now"". On the return I had to plead for a drink only to get a very aggressive member of staff thrust a can of juice at me before saying ""now go sit down"". After booking with BA I was disappointed to find AA codeshare and operate the flight as I was not prepared for the awful aircraft used the lack of IFE the poor quality food and the stunningly nasty approach by the cabin crew. Would never choose or recommend this airline.";NEGATIVE

At 7.20 am the next morning we learned that they had no pilot for the flight delayed again. I am very dissatisfied with AA customer service and I will no longer be flying with this company.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-05;I normally fly Southwest exclusively - so you can imagine the culture shock when I found myself booked (by my company) on an American flight from SFO to JFK. The only thing I can say positively is that the food was really fantastic quite unexpected for in-flight cuisine. The drinks also came very consistently. The crew were not unpleasant but not quite up to the standards of the Southwest culture. And for a completely redesigned seat the Business Class seat was the most uncomfortable thing I have endured. I am 5'1 so my feet never touched the floor. I tried every adjustment on the panel but nothing worked. Finally I just used my provided pillow to stuff behind me to make my feet touch the floor. Between that and the leg rest I was able to get a little sleep on the way home. There was no indication of how to use the video screen in front of me or any explanation of how to operate the headphone (where the jack was located etc.) or anything. I stopped flying American about 12 years ago and now I remember why.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-05;"I just took this trip in fact I arrived back home last night. The trip out: went online to get boarding passes had to choose my seats (two flights). I chose my seat for the first flight no problem. Chose my seat for the second flight: $28 later I had both boarding passes. Silly me I expected when I bought my ticket that I would have a seat without paying extra not so I was in a so called ""upgrade"" seat which I didn't ask for nor did I want but that was all that was left. I did not get anything extra for having paid for a so called ""upgraded"" seat. I had to do the same thing on the return trip. Also you have to pay for your luggage. On the return trip I purchased a sandwich for $9.99 which was most definitely the worst sandwich I have ever had. I will fly Southwest when in need of a flight you purchase a fare from them you not only have a seat that you don't have to pay extra for your first bag is free.";NEGATIVE

The seats on AA far more comfortable than on BA greater privacy with 1-2-1 configuration free access without having to step over the neighboring passenger plus all seats facing forward something I never liked on BA set up with window seats facing backward. Inflight entertainment beats BA in every respect screens double the size appeared to be HD greater choice of movies. Food was delicious well presented good choice of wines. Ice cream sundae elevated the meal to a guilty decadence. Overall great experience and highly recommended.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-04;LAX to Phoenix. We were really unhappy with the customer service of American Airlines employees at LAX. We had a flight coming into LAX run really late and were bumped to a later flight the next day. We arrived to the airport at 8.00 and our flight to Phoenix was departing at 9.25. I usually arrive to airports about 1.5 hours before a domestic flight and this is usually plenty of time. We checked in at the kiosk but the computer would not print the bag tags. We grabbed an airline employee who directed us to a baggage check line for others with issues with the printing. It was only four people deep so we were not too worried. After about 20 minutes and the line had barely moved we started to become nervous. We tried talking to a couple agents about taking our bags from us and sticking them on a later flight so we could still make it to our gate. They were all at the most apathetic and kept telling us there was nothing they could do. By the time we finally got to the counter we had been in line 45 minutes. There were two employees working this whole time even though the process seemed to be incredibly slow. This inefficient system and lacking customer service caused us to miss our flight. Maybe I would think this was normal airline behavior but we have flown with Alaskan airlines in LAX when a connecting flight caused us to come in late. Their employees were very helpful took our bags and sent them on a later flight and even pushed us through security to ensure we made the plane. In the end I will never chose American again if I can help it.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-02;Upon checking in at my starting location I was informed by the AA rep that my flight was being delayed an hour to leave for O'Hare which was a problem as my connecting flight was to leave an hour and 10 minutes after arriving at O'Hare which turned into one mess up after another which would have had me reaching my final destination 2.5+ hrs after scheduled. I reached O'Hare (more delays) and eventually walked out of the airport and took a charter bus reaching my destination before the flight even left Chicago! Avoid American Airlines travelers.;NEGATIVE

Another plane found boarded and headed to the runway around 7pm. We waited on the runway for 1.5 hours because of ""weather"" (even though other flights on the same route were taking off) then told we had to go back to the gate. One flight attendant then got into a screaming match with a passenger (extremely unprofessional) while I waited with an upset baby for 15 minutes in the roasting hot gangway because they couldn't find anyone to bring up the gate-checked strollers. Finally the ""weather"" was okay to allow us to leave but a new crew was needed we finally left around 11.30pm. And then because LGA was closed it landed at JFK instead. Nothing positive to say about this airline. To be avoided if at all possible.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-01;Business Class trip Tokyo to Dallas. Attendants were rude! It was 45 minutes after take off before we were given audio headsets and 45 minutes before landing they gathered them up. My husband's didn't work and it was a chore to get a replacement pair. We felt like we were intruding on their day! Beverage service was a joke. This was a 12 hour flight and we were given beverages 4 times. We flew first class on various Asian airlines and the service was excellent. I will not fly American again!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-06-01;I've been flying for over 30 years and I have never come close to missing a flight. In April 14 I travelled with American from Miami to Washington DC and their awful check in staff caused my group to miss our flight. There was a cut off check-in time of 9.13am and we arrived about 8.55am and were told not to go the counter but to use self- check-in. We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in. Again we went to the oh-so-friendly staff which said go to the counter as it will be quick and there is not queue. Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time. The staff couldn't have carried less and just flat out refused to help even thigh it was their fault. We were told that we needed to book in 2hrs before the flight but not only was this not listed on our ticket but our pre-printed boarding passes had 9.13am. I've got no apologies form the company and was left with missing our afternoon in Washington.;NEGATIVE

Gate agents were horrible - that is the only part of the trip that was bad. Flight boarded quickly and pilot apologized for the delay. Flight attendants in economy were really great - friendly and prompt to respond to requests. Breakfast was french toast and there was a lot of food provided - I was surprised as usually breakfasts on AA Int'l are small. 2 movies shown on the overhead monitors - this is where AA fails without excuse. These planes need AVOD in each seat - end of story - period. But the service made up for it. Left Chicago 45 min late - arrived London 15 min late. Bags were already there when we got out of immigration. Good flight and service. The Purser was amazing also - helping out in both cabins and very friendly.;POSITIVE

By far the worst and stressful experience I have ever had. I will never fly with American again.;NEGATIVE

Return was on new B738 no complaints whatsoever everything to schedule however DFW-LHR on B772 was delayed approx 70 mins due to passengers trying to stow ""hand luggage"" larger than our hold luggage but again flight crew must've put the pedal to the metal as only arrived 15 mins late. Did not as one of life's great sleepers use the IFE on any legs and do not have any great expectations on airline food so wasn't disappointed.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-28;We flew from Las Vegas to JFK New York on 23rd May this year with American Airlines and we have never encountered such rude and unhelpful flight attendants. It was a 4.5 hour flight and they only came round with the drinks trolley once at the beginning of the flight and when I asked for some water was told that she wasn't there to run round after me! I was horrified but told her that I would follow her down to the galley and get my own water so she stormed off and brought me one back. The whole flight she was abrupt and rude. There were 6 of us in the party on holiday in 3 separate cities in USA. That was the only one where we encountered rude and nasty staff.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-27;LHR-LAX. After reading about the new business class cabin on American's 777-300 we decided to book our trip with them. We made a great choice. At Heathrow there is a separate 'flagship check in' outside the main terminal which was quick calm and very quiet. The Admiral's Club at LHR is disappointing - more like a cafe/canteen with strip lighting. Anyway once on board the cabin was great - the seats are a winner with a real feeling of privacy the screen is huge and there's a big choice of films and the food was good. Crew warmed up after a while and responded well to all requests. The walk-up bar had loads of snacks and was topped up throughout. Flight was on time. Remote stand a bit of pain but I understand this is due to construction. Definitely recommend.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-26;MXP-JFK return in economy. Boeing 767-300 was comfortable and silent service just okay seats cramped food too limited for a long range flight both inbound and outbound. Inflight entertainment just OK. Asked for upgrading purchase on return flight at check-in and was told from AA lady at counter the price was USD 7000 one way - unbelievable what a joke! Avoid AA from Milan fly Delta or Emirates.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-25;Boeing 777-300 GRU-JFK First Class. True waste of money or miles until crew's sense of premium service matches product. Last night First Class service in my flight was a joke : from the warm champagne to the traffic of crew members congregated in the service area socializing quite loudly in the middle of the night. to the dirty wine glass. Unpleasant main dish and Breakfast service so rushed that it felt as if it was coach. Do not seat in 2A as crew will bother you with the curtain hitting your seat every time they march between cabins (all night long). Great product but substandard service. Stay in business.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-25;The food was ghastly. Dallas Fort Worth to London breakfast was a measly white bread bun bare on the tray (no plate or even plastic) with butter and cheese with a small tub of yoghurt and a small orange juice. The dinner chicken tasted awful. The service from the cabin staff was abrupt and short. Some hand wipes at meal times would be great as the toilets left much to be desired. Also at meal times they would not remind passengers to put their chairbacks up like the attendants on the other airlines I mostly use. I think Qatar Airways is doing itself a disservice by aligning with American Airlines on code share flights. I particularly booked with Qatar Airways as their service is always impeccable.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-24;If there was a way to rate this company's service to a score less than 1 I would do that. I booked my flight all confirmed connecting through Chicago. In Chicago after a gate change and an hour delay they cancelled the flight to my destination. No options no direction just cancelled. Then after 30 min on the call I talked to them for rebooking. Nothing available. I got someone at a kiosk to help and they booked me on a flight 2 DAYS later whereas I had to be at a conference the next morning. Needless to say that was not an option. I rented a car and drove 10 hours straight to my destination getting to my destination at 4am. Then it is time to get back home and they tell me they have canceled my return ticket because I did not complete my trip. No warning no notification nothing. Just cancelled. So I had to pay for another ticket to get back home. There were many people like me on that plane. People from across the world who couldn't even speak English and they were lost and confused. I ended up helping one of them. There is no excuse for this. This is the worst none customer service oriented company I have ever dealt with. Avoid this airline by all means even if you have to pay a little more to go with another airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-20;"We flew Toronto to Chicago. paid almost $700 per ticket which was very expensive considering it was an 1.5 hour flight. When we booked the flight we thought it was through WestJet as it was advertised that way but in small writing at the bottom it said operated by American Airlines which we didn't see when we booked the flight otherwise we wouldn't have booked it. We had a very bad experience with AA a few years ago and refused to book any more flights with them. This time both flights were delayed. When returning they had oversold so my sister and I volunteered to take a later flight. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the incompetence of the staff. it took them an hour and a half to figure out how to give us our vouchers which is ridiculous because they told us we couldn't leave the gate until they gave us the voucher so we couldn't even go and have dinner or anything. On top of that the rep there kept saying she had no idea what she was doing and this was her first time doing vouchers - then get someone who knows what they're doing rather than wasting an hour just trying to figure it out yourself doesn't give us a lot of confidence in your abilities. Other issue was that they kept changing the gate to the flight (it was changed 4 times no exaggeration) and when we would go up to the desk to make sure it was there every person at the desk was extremely rude and one actually said to us ""can't you read the monitor?"" and when we explained that our ticket had a different number than what was on the monitor they gave us a dirty look and said that what they had was right (it wasn't in the end which is pathetic). it would be nice that if you were going to change the gates. at least inform people and let them know. Another minor thing was with the flight attendant she was grabbing something from the bin above my sister and her bag kept hitting my sister's head several times. and she wouldn't even apologize even though she saw it happening. she just gave us a look like how dare you sit there and be in my way when she was the one who was in our way. Very rude and terrible customer service. Will never fly again. I am not even going to use my voucher because that would mean I would have to travel again with this airline.";NEGATIVE

We were all curios as to why we got so close to being in the air before this ""issue"" was noticed - it is pretty obvious it wasn't Pilot error they completey felt our pain as did the flight attendants and gate workers. Of course we were re-booking a whole (S80) plane so it was obvius that we would have to wait for a plane to dead head. Fortunately that didn't take too long and we were just 2 hours late getting into SAT. Cudos to Capt Smith and his first officer for getting us home safely and the flight attendants that had to be dead on their feet undoubtably they all had a very stressful evening.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-20;Hope to never fly American Airlines again. I Was flying from Wichita KS to Dallas to my final destination Las Vegas on 5/18/2014. Our 3:00 flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Things happen so that was not a big deal how the situation was handled is my issue. All passengers with a connecting flight from Dallas was asked to stand in line there were about 40 to 50 passengers in line. There 2 American Airlines Rep working the counters needless to say they were very rude and short. They acted as if they were the one with the problem. They acted as if they did not care if the passengers found a connecting flight or not. I stood in line from approx 1:30 pm to 4:15pm well over 2 hours. Each Rep spent an average of 20 to 30 minutes per customer. At 4:15 2 more Reps appeared from the back however they did not have a clue what they were doing. The first guy told me that all Dallas flights were full and there was nothing available until the next morning and when I arrived in Dallas they would arrange for a hotel for the night. The person in line behind me. also going to Vegas was assisted by a different Rep who manage to find a flight for her and her 3 children. So I went back to the counter and spoke to a different Rep who was then able to find me a flight home that night. Needless to say this whole situation was very stressful and left a very bad reflection on American Airlines.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-19;"First and last time I will fly AA. Was ""bumped"" off original flight without being asked just told ""sorry you are now on next flight"". Next flight was supposed to be in 35 mins. I told flight attendant that if the flight was late I would miss my connecting flight she said ""sorry I don't make the rules"". Gentleman beside me said he would gladly wait for next flight as he didn't have a connection to make. She said ""no sorry"". Of course the flight was delayed and I missed my connection in Chicago. Once in Chicago I was told the next available flight was the next morning and no hotel or food voucher would be provided as it was an ""ATC"" issue not a AA issue on why there was a delay. What is ATC I asked - Air Traffic Control. AA had lots of people ""sleeping"" in O'Hare airport and it really was sad when you see seniors in wheelchairs having to sleep in their wheelchair because the cot they received was too low to the floor for them to lay down. Then the kicker is at 4am security is yelling wake up time to move along sleep time is over get moving. As I said first and last time I and many others will be travelling on AA.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-18;When we arrived at the airport all of the other airlines had fairly short check-in queues American Airlines filled up their queue and had a line going 30 yards down the hallway. It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful. I had taken 4 advil at this point and still had back pain. Never again American Airlines never again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-16;"Connecting flight from Dallas to Knoxville cancelled for ""maintenance"". Customer Service agents were clueless and basically no help and really not concerned that the flight was cancelled. Stayed in airport for 5 hours attempting to get on another flight via standby with no luck. Once it was determined I was stuck in Dallas they provided vouchers for a place to stay (can't call it a hotel) and $19 worth of food with the next flight out the next day. After waiting for the shuttle for an hour we finally were on our way for a good nights rest or so we thought. Once we arrived it was obvious this was a pay by the hour motel called ""The Night Hotel"". Wow This place was basically a brothel built around a night club. The next morning we were waiting on our 5 AM cab ride to the airport and 4 prostitutes came walking through the door. Bottom line I can't believe American Airlines had the audacity to do what they did.";NEGATIVE

We were offered no compensation for the cancellation no apologies no Hotel or Meal vouchers. We had to sleep at the airport on a chair. Needless to say we will no longer ever use American Airlines to fly.";NEGATIVE

Ate nothing as my vegetarian food requests had been overlooked/ignored (despite it being on my ticket) no apology or attempt to offer an alternative. Overall a very poor partner to BA.

Reason who knows no 2nd pilot was the reason given. Got another flight time. Rain storm came. Two more flights delayed moved to different gate delayed then cancelled. What to do? No hotels taxi line 2 miles long. I left the boarding area so couldn't get back upstairs. Had to spend the night in a hard chair. Finally had to book a flight to Fort Wayne Indiana so I could get home. No flights to Toledo. What a nightmare experience!;NEGATIVE

I was at O'Hare in Chicago flying to Phoenix and departing at 11.35. I left the airport today in Chicago feeling like I got stranded with no help and to fend for myself. I have never had a cancelled flight and didn't know what to do. I followed everyone else and waited to speak to an agent in line for almost 2 hours. When it was my turn to speak to someone they closed the line down and said we needed to go to the booking desk. I had no idea where that was and tried to ask. After being ignored one of the agents snapped at me and told me they couldn't help me unless I was flying to Dallas. They wouldn't even direct me on where I needed to go. I will never fly this airline again after I finally get home tomorrow. Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.;NEGATIVE

We had to wait in line (I waited 1.5 hours) at ONT to get on a new connecting flight out of DAL. The seats on the plane out of ONT were tiny old creaky and uncomfortable and staff were disinterested and unfriendly. There was no ""inflight entertainment"" to speak of. The worst came however when we arrived at DAL. Immediately upon disembarking we were informed that ""there are no hotel rooms left in Dallas"". The customer service reps feebly tried to console people with Nature Valley granola bars and cheaply-made cots but everyone was in a mostly miserable mood. I and many others ended up trying to sleep on chairs through the night. Very few people got any sleep. Terrible experience all around. The last time I fly American.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-05-13;I flew from JFK to LHR with my family on 9th May. I was very pleased with the flight experience. I value a good entertainment system more which this Boeing 777 had with personal power outlet than the quality of food. There are restaurants at JFK that offer various choices. The irplane is not a restaurant. Food is a + but my values are on the seat comfort more. Seats were comfortable. Service was very efficient and fast. I also liked the dimmed cabin. Only bad thing was that the AC fan was on a quite heavy mode. Crew were mostly very friendly.;POSITIVE

First you have to queue to help yourself at one of the self-service check in machine. After waiting for approximately 10 minutes we go through the check in procedure experienced some problem and had to get help from the staff member at the check in station. In the end we were unable to check in and were asked to go to the customer service counter. The staff member at the counter asks us to wait and disappears for 5 to 10 min and when he returns he advises us that we are now to late to check in luggage as it is less than an hour before departure and we are talking about 10 minutes now. He advises us that we can fly but our luggage cannot. Only option is to take a flight the next day pay $120 to change the flight and pay for another night in a hotel. The main issue here is the rude attitude of the staff. We can accept that there are rules to be followed but the attitude of the staff is a disgrace. AA have never been a great airline but this experience is by far the worst we have ever experience with any airline. We will do our very best to avoid flying AA again.;NEGATIVE

Why not serve lovely breakfast? Crew was keen to get meal service over and disappear for the remainder of the flight. Flight diverted to IAH due to low fuel / weather but almost no announcements from flight deck. On American Eagle flight attendant was rude and not professionally dressed. She wore a crumpled uniform and believe it or not Dutch-style clogs. Overall it is so sad that there is no sophistication nor manner / culture at the ""new"" American Airlines.

american-airlines;2014-05-11;We took this airline from Raleigh to London because we expected a similar service to BA with which it codeshares. Unfortunately we were so wrong! There is firstly no modern inflight entertainment system for economy class and the food was dreadful. Onboard service was rushed and not very friendly and to top it all we had one of the flight attendants talking loudly with passengers at the back throughout the whole night.

Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale.

Good to know that if you have an international connection via DFW you no longer need to retrieve and recheck your baggage to your final destination. We went through immigration very fast and headed for the Admiral's Club which is really disappointing: no snacks except for cookies only 1 alcoholic drink per person unfriendly staff. On the bright side wifi was good and the view on the tarmac was excellent. The DFW-YUL leg was on a newer 737 and it was an uneventful flight with a good lunch but a very poor selection of drinks. Nice staff.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-28;I flew from San Francisco to Heathrow on April 26th and found the airline crew working in economy to be both unfriendly and unprofessional. The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again. AA show a video to their passengers before a flight which promotes the technology investments they have made in relation to improving the customer experience. I would recommend to AA that they focus more attention and investment into the training of their crew to provide a better service to their customers.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-28;"Flew MIA-BCN business class. I am a long user of AA but always inside the US or from Venezuela to US. This is the first time I took AA to Europe usually when going to Spain I use Iberia. I had very low expectations but must say I was impressed. This flight was on the o767 the cabin in business is the ""old business class"" with seats that do not lie flat but I must say that it was comfortable enough to take a 4 hour sleep. Amenities kit nice and pretty. No private screen but a Samsung tablet was provided not a huge a mount of options but it was more than Ok. The biggest surprise? Food was excellent and in amounts that I have never seen before in other Business class. Plenty of bubbly. Service extraordinary FA's smiling and helpful.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-28;AA flight 1612 from Phoenix to Dallas/Fort Worth was great. Plane was only 1 year old flight servers were fantastic and funny excellent beverage service and communication from captain to passengers polite timely and sincere. Really liked the comfort of the plane extra leg room soft comfortable seats and inscreen TV monitor.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-27;Flew DFW to FRA on 777. Crew was very helpful. Nice entertainment. Good food! This is one of the best airlines in the US.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-24;LGA-PBI April 19th 2014 was overall great. Flight was on time and we even landed early. The crew of flight attendants and pilots were nothing great flight attendants didn't give much personal attention to the passengers it seemed. We were seated in Main Cabin Extra in the front row (8A8B8C). Main Cabin Extra is supposed to have 6 inches of extra legroom since we were seated in the front with the bulkhead in front of us which is really just a wall for those of you who don't know it did not feel like we had 6 inches of legroom and it felt very cramped through the whole area. If you are about to pay extra money for main cabin extra avoid the first rows which is row 8. I'm not sure about 8D 8E 8F but I assume it's the same. Also the tray tables are considerably smaller because they are stowed in the arm rest. But they are kind of cool to an airline enthusiast like myself because it feels like a first class seat. We did not have to pay for Main Cabin Extra because my family had Gold member free Main Cabin Extra so for us it didn't matter but if you have to pay for MCE I would sit any row behind 8. All in all great flight and I love American they will always be my #1 airline to fly and I would still recommend flying them just not in row 8 MCE.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-22;My recent trip with American Airlines has made me become a United loyalist. I have sworn to myself to never fly American again. The horror started at the check-in at JFK. You'd think if there was a merger between American and US Airways that passengers could check in anywhere. No the quite literally 60 open and manned desks were for US Airways passengers only while the AA passengers had to get in line somewhere off to the side where there were two people working. On the plane a stewardess was sitting on the jump seat in the exit row and could not stop talking to a passenger in a very loud voice. Returning from LA the check-in procedure was hands down the most inefficient system I've seen in my life. Once boarded we had a plane from I don't know when but practically no one's baggage fit in the overhead compartment everyone had to check their bags and the whole thing delayed us by about thirty minutes. The stewardess must have elbowed me in the head at least a dozen times and woke me up once to ask if I'd like to drink something. No thank I was fine just sleeping. Never flying American again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-22;Dallas to London in Business. The new AA cabin looks very good - spacious flat bed seats lots of storage and a big screen. However it was let down by slow service food that was simply not up to standard and the IFE froze and was not reset. AA has got the basics right but needs to work on the details.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-22;Several flights over the last month LA to Santa Fe Sioux a City Chicago Denver Las Vegas Lax Honolulu. All flights on time had preferred seating on all flights where available and could notice difference. Crew reasonably friendly although best crew LAX-HNL. Negative definitely good for purchase LAX-HNL Cheese and fruit not worth the money Turkey and & Chutney sandwich bread very dry and stale. Again not worth the money. American take a lesson from many International airlines and what they offer Economy passengers in a 5 hour sector. Would still recommend as a US Domestic carrier.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-22;If you have to fly with someone don't fly with AA. They made me check in my carry on luggage and were unable to open the undercarriage door making me miss my connector flight to Atlanta. I had to stay overnight in Chicago due to their failure. I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues. They had defuelling issues on the plane and everyone had to deboard. They are now trying to get us on a different plane. Do not fly with this company unless you want to pay a lot of money for a ticket to arrive a day later and potentially lose your luggage. Worst airline I've ever used so far.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-22;Mediocre service. Just flew from John Wayne to DFW and the flight was freezing. I asked for a blanket and was told they don't have any only to see unopened blankets on every seat in first class. I guess only first class passengers are worthy of being comfort. That really irritated me after freezing for two hours to see that they could have very easily provided a blanket. Really poor customer service. To actually say they don't have blankets when they do and you then see them.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-21;Nothing wrong with the service or the food but on some routes such as Barcelona to New York the planes are old and do not have individual entertainment systems. This means you have to watch whatever film is being shown on the overhead monitors making for a very long trip. There is a huge amount of competition out there so unless AA/US Air get new planes I will not be flying with them again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-21;Day trip from LGA to ORD First class. Never flown with AA before but was impressed. Lounges not as good as BA's but cabin crew delivered excellent service both ways. Outbound lunch was tasty chicken salad and cookies and dinner on the return was a tasty pasta dish with a dessert. Brandy and chocolates rounded it off very well.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-21;JFK-MIA-BOG round trip early-April 2014 in economy. American Airlines staff are consistently rude and grumpy. I am constantly surprised when once in a while there is a ground staff or cabin crew member who are actually polite and helpful.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-21;"GRU-DFW in new 773. What a great and enjoyable flight. New plane comfortable seats excellent food huge movie selection and a wonderful crew. If this is the ""new"" American they have got it right!";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-21;NYC/JFK to BUE/EZE. Flights AA953/09Apr and AA954/14Apr. Both flights departed on time and both arrived early operated with B777-200 equipment. Check in procedures at both airports efficient and quick with smiles. Seat width adequate seat pitch could use an additional inch but seat cushion comfort rock hard and unacceptable! I saw nothing international about their heralded international flagship service. The dinners served in both directions were big on flavor/taste but small in serving size. The salad ex/NYC had seen better days but the salad ex/BUE was crisp excellent and fresh. Dessert ex/NYC was a tasty pre-packaged chocolate brownie but only a 'Bon o Bon' ex/BUE. What was referred to as breakfast on both flights was a warm croissant with butter and jam served with OJ and a fruit yoghurt ex/NYC and OJ a very fresh fruit salad ex/BUE. The catering ex/BUE was of a much higher calibre/quality than that out of NYC/JFK. On both flights the inflight cabin crews were efficiently friendly and served with smiles. Where AA really excelled was how they treated me as a WCHC wheelchair passenger. Everyone I came in contact with in both cities and inflight both AA staff and their handling agents treated me with care dignity and respect! Would have NO problem recommending AA to others for their air travel.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-17;"American Airlines gave away our 3 first class seats on Flight 53 from MIA to DFW on Sunday April 13 despite the fact that we were at the gate 17 minutes before flight time. The agent had already left the with the standby passengers. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to AMA and to have to overnight at DFW. Also one of our party had to fly coach even though we purchased a first class seat. I used to worry that with the merger AA 's customer service would sink to U.S. Airs level. Now I'm afraid the ""new American Airlines"" will sink to an even lower level. They sent our luggage on to our final destination. I have lifetime Platinum status on AA for having flown over 2.2 million miles with them.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-16;Flew LHR to Miami on a 777 in the new business class. Seating very comfortable. It was a daytime flight so I can't comment on the seat for an overnight flight. Great service. Food very acceptable. IFE excellent. Lounge at LHR is adequate nothing more. Immigration officer at MIA was the rudest man I've come across in a long time but that's not AA's fault. Their pre-landing video suggests that the immigration staff are there to help - not!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-15;I just took a trip 2 weeks ago. Flew from Chicago to Dallas Dallas to El Salvador. We landed in Dallas with 27 minutes until our next flight was leaving so we ran through the airport made my flight and thought there is was no way our luggage made it! We were so excited when we arrived in El Salvador to find that all of our bags made it.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-15;"13 April 2014. AA1119 from Boston to Chicago ORD. AA1159 from Chicago to St Louis. There was a major delay due to the weather. So I checked with the crew at gate B30 before I board in Boston. She said AA1159 would also be delayed so it's ok. While I was checking my flight connection the other crew used the microphone and told everyone ""If you are woried about your connection don't be."" When we landed in Chicago I checked the gate for AA1159 via my phone status ""In Flight"". The gate was H11B so I went to the crew at H11A see what can they do for me. Since there were no more flights to St Louis they can only schedule me for the first flight the next morning. I asked where I could stay for the night told me I could stay at the gate or she could offer me a hotel for reduce rate. I decided to stay at the gate.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-15;Flight from LA to JAX via Miami was uneventful. Flight from JAX to Dallas was a total different story! Our flight left Florida at 7.20 am. After an hour in the air the captain announced we had to land urgently in Birmingham Alabama. Around 10 am they told us the mechanic was on the way and would take one more hour! By noon they announced there would be a plane coming from Dallas and should be in Birmingham by noon. We would be on our way and arrive at Dallas by 2.30 pm. I called an agent and was told there was only flight available leaving Dallas at 8.30 pm and arriving at LAX at 10.40 pm. We continued to wait and wondered what happened to the plane. The plane arrived in Birmingham at 3.00 pm. We were boarded by 3.20 pm. We were not moving for another two hours. Finally arrived to Dallas after 7 pm. Most of us had missed connecting flights and were told there would be an agent waiting for us at the gate to rebook our flights. There was no one waiting at the gate. I finally got on the next flight out of Dallas and felt lucky to be able to get on the 8.10 flight to arrive in LA at 9.40 pm. Arrived at LAX at 9.30 pm and told there was no gate available for another 20-30 min. We waited on the plane for 1 hr 40 min. I probably will not fly AA again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-15;4/13/14. Flew from Rochester NY to Chicago. Plane was 45 minutes late due to weather taxiing from far reaches of O'Hare then no crew at taxiway. Missed our connection to Seattle. All flights overbooked so could not get on via standby had to stay overnight and pay for a hotel. Told our first class tickets through Travelocity were really Economy with instant upgrade we ultimately went coach 20 or so hours late. Never again. They did give us two $300 vouchers good for future travel within a year.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-14;We flew Heathrow to Puerto Rico 2 adults and 3 children under 12. When we tried to check-in online there were only 5 paid seats together - the others were scattered around the plane. Clearly we couldn't sit the 3 children on their own so we contacted AA and were told we'd have to pay the extra (£220) and book the paid seats which we did very reluctantly. When we checked in at the desk however we were told we couldn't have the seats we'd booked and were given 5 others which were a 2 and a 3. During the second leg of the trip we were given exit seats which were not allowed for children as we were told they would be 'a good bargaining tool' for swaps. On the return we couldn't sit at all near each other: 3 of us sat on the very back row and 2 at the front of the plane. However AA used BA as a carrier for the final leg - they had automatically allocated five seats together because we were travelling with children and allowed us onto the plane first - a completely different attitude from AA. I agree with former reviews - the seatbelt signs hardly went off on the AA flights which is unacceptable on long-haul. I have claimed a refund for the booked seats which we didn't get - am waiting to see if I'll actually get the money back.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-08;When we used to be able to fly through Chicago O'hare AA wasn't as bad. The last 12 times we've gone through DFW the plane sits on the runway after arrival for 30 minutes every time. This makes even an average time between connections tight. Then we get to our gate and the gate has changed while we're on the skytrain. And too often the flight is cancelled for no known reason. AA changes my seat unbeknown to me until check in which irks me. I do not care for the new 737s. All seats are 3+3 so there are no good rows and already tray tables are broken lights don't work and I don't think they fix them often. My husband is a 'top' platinum so he doesn't have some of the problems I do but he's not pleased anymore either.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-07;"Have lived outside the US for 20+ years. Have flown many long haul flights to European hubs and then on to different cities in the US. We usually fly on British Airways (great airline) or KLM or Delta. For the first time was forced (because of a change in flight schedules) to fly on American Airlines from DFW to London (Heathrow) yesterday. So many things wrong: seatbelt sign on for most of the flight despite only occasional mild turbulence. Not acceptable on a 9 hour flight. The flight attendants were not friendly or service oriented. They mostly communicated with each other and acted annoyed when interacting with passengers. or they just sat in the galley. On this long flight a request for another small bottle of water (in business class) was denied: ""Only one per customer"". They did not come around even once during the night to offer drinks. Unless there is no other choice avoid long-haul trips on this airline. The ground staff were a little better still not customer oriented.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-07;My husband and I have been trying to get home since 4/6/2014 we were booked on a flight at 4.10 after a one hour delay they cancelled it. We couldn't get booked on another flight so we had to stay over. They booked us on flight #2575 at 9.25 then overnight somehow we got cancelled even though we had recheck boarding passes. We were re- booked for a noon flight #2419. Then after being directed to 2 different gates and waiting in the airport for over 12 hours today 4/7/2014 our flights to Albuquerque were canceled. We were sent to 5 different gates during the 12 hours. 3 cancellations in 24 hours it's unacceptable customer service. We still don't know if we're actually going to have a plane at 8.20 flight #1285.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-06;My husband and I were on flight 2224 from Las Vegas on April 4. The airplane was an S-80. We flew first class and were very disappointed. The only difference between first and the rest of the plane was a wider seat and meal. The plane didn't have movies or music. Bare bones plane for sure. Also a constant stream of people walking from the back of the plane to use front lavatory. Also alcohol is plentiful if you drink however I wanted ice tea and that is not an option. Maybe they don't know that it is available in bottles or cans.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-06;AA997 DFW-EZE on 4 April - First Class. Overall a great experience. The purser was very personable and professional. 777-200 plane which has seen better days - for a first class seat (that I will say was super comfortable to sleep in as it was totally flat and they give you a thin mattress which makes it much better) there were so many little tears and things that made the seat look tatty. Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience. But for the price and the overall service - AA wins on this flight. I have recently had a lot of flights and AA has been doing great. Keep up the great work!;POSITIVE

american-airlines;2014-04-04;We flew in from Jamaica to Dallas Fort Worth Texas and our flight was delayed. The biggest problem was that there was little information given to passengers. After 2 hours we found out we were waiting for a crew to arrive from another destination. After being delayed 4 hours we finally got on the plane to sit on the runway for another 45 minutes. The pilot said we were being re-routed due to weather and did not have enough fuel and would have to go back to the gate to refuel. We reach the gate at 2am and wait to only be told the flight was now cancelled. This is where I truly get frustrated with the way things were handled. 150+ passengers are told their flight is cancelled but there is no other flights going into Louisville. You will have to find another way home or wait until Wednesday (6 days later)! We wait in line another 1.5 hrs to try and find a flight close to home willing to drive the rest of the way. The gate agents have been no help whatsoever it was 5.30 in the morning and they offered no cots or anything to us. There were no hotel rooms. They did give us a $12 voucher for a meal. Finally got a late flight almost 24 hours later to Cincinnati but now have to incur additional expense of renting a car to get home. Tried to get on a couple of standby flights but I have noticed that AA overbooked every flight and boots people off so stand by is a joke. Highly disappointed!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-03;Paid $1700 for two seats. Airline website would not allow us to choose seats at time of booking. Return a week later to book and lo and behold only paid seats left. Call Airline and told unless we pay and additional $170 per person we will have to depend on the kindness of others to move seats so we can sit together. This is absolute crap. If you can't book your seats at time of booking then don't buy the ticket unless you're willing to pay additional $$$ to actually get a seat.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-03;We flew from MCO via MIA to Punta Cana. The first leg was fine and for an hours flight every was completely satisfying. The second leg from Miami to Punta Cana was a total disappointment for my first international flight with AA. At the airport I was rejected to enter the lounge as for flights to The Caribbean the access is excluded. This logic I will never understand. The two flight attendants have been absolutely passive in their service and spent their time rather with making jokes with each other or actively ignoring requests such as a glass of water or getting visa documents. One flight attendant had his hands in his pockets at all times - while going through the aisle. I have never been so disappointed from a Business Class flight before. For sure AA will not have me as a customer onboard again and I am glad that there are a lot of options on the US flight market.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-02;AA 324 MCO-DFW in First. Flight on time pre-ordered snack delivered cheerfully pre-departure drinks offered. Inflight the Attendant could not do enough for everyone. Ordered 5 star connecting service and arrival service. Was met at the arriving gate at DFW and taken by golf cart to the Admirals Club in Concourse D. I was able to bypass the Admirals club check in line handed Premium Drink vouchers and told I would be greeted by someone else to take me to my next flight. Shortly afterward the weather turned horrible for about an hour. My new 5 star agent found me in the Admirals Club and asked if I had any questions. I had her check to make sure the plane taking me to Santiago Chile made it on the ground. She came back to confirm it was on the ground but waiting for a gate due to the weather. Near boarding time she collected me and carted me off to the gate. I was carted back to the Admirals Club and asked to be kept informed of the situation. I was collected again and informed the new plane was ready but they were under tight time constraints to get it going due to crew time restraints. AA's Flagship suite is comfortable the turn down service pyjamas slippers and kit were all very nice. The international crew in First save for one employee were polite but simply went through the motions. The food was decent. Filled out the Breakfast Card and awoke to a nice breakfast and a wonderful view of the Andes as the sun was rising. Despite the Delay in DFW good job by AA.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-02;"I arrived 4 hours early for my late afternoon flight to Orlando after my cruise. I was confirmed in Main Cabin Extra. Miami has always been a ""challenging"" airport but not having been there in over a decade it was a whole new challenge. My bag was 5 lbs overweight so I had to go buy a small personal carry item and remove 5 lbs from my bag. Needless to say a huge hassle. Since I checked in so early American did not offer to put me on one of the several flight before mine but they certainly did send my bag early as it was already in this huge mire when I arrived in Orlando. The security situation in Miami is a nightmare. Once finally through the drama the new terminal AA built was nice with allot more choices of things to do but it seemed gate after gate I passed no one cleaned up the trash left by the customers. Flight boarded on time I asked for some tissue got it promptly then only saw the Flight attendants during seat belt check before and take off and landing. They all seemed to pile into F class and offer multiple drink rounds. Main Cabin Extra is what AA Coach used to be minus the service. We arrived on time and my bag had been waiting hours for me. No complaints.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-04-02;I hadn't flown American since the mid-80s when the service varied between passive-aggressive and actively unpleasant. Things have improved since then. The service on two flights - business from Miami to San Jose and economy from Panama City to Miami - was fine and even friendly. But the entertainment food etc show less sign of change.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-31;6 flights with AA in the past month or two. JFK-MIA: Arrived at check-in counter on time. Staff were friendly enough and seemed to be at ease but maintained proper professionalism. Flight waited 20 minutes at the gate before taxiing because of some missing passengers. Nice well maintained 757 seats were comfortable although not the best and flight attendants were nice. Rather bad entertainment. 2 hour flight landed in Miami with no issues. MIA-MGA (Nicaragua): Had roughly a 2 hour layover until connecting flight was scheduled. Everything went smoothly no complaints there. Flight into Managua was a little worse - 757 was a bit dilapidated and we had about an hour delay before taking off. Staff at the gate upon landing pointed us towards our destination and were very welcoming. MGA-MIA-JFK: Return flight went well nothing really remarkable. Everything was on time staff were nice and helpful seats were alright. JFK-LHR: On one of the older 777-200ER aircraft. Staff very friendly and professional. One of the flight attendants even went as far as to sit down and conduct conversation with a few of the passengers during the flight and gave off a very good vibe. Throughout the 6 hour flight the flight the attendants came around frequently and often were available to provide passengers with snacks and drinks whenever prompted. Seats were surprisingly comfortable and the flight wasn't even half full so almost everyone in Economy had the chance to fully recline across the 5 seat middle aisle (One of the advantages of the 200ER over the 300ER). Meals were actually pretty decent and I had few complaints. Fairly good entertainment with a selection of about 30 films and 10 TV shows. Flight landed smoothly and we were quickly on our way through customs and security. LHR-JFK: The flight was a little more crowded but there was still room to switch seats and there were a few open middle aisles to lie down on. Lunch was a small pizza which wasn't too bad. Flight landed smoothly and there were staff at the door to greet us. Would fly again.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-31;I was traveling home from Palm Springs CA. through Dallas. Flight was delayed 3 times through e-mail notification before any gate agent was seen. When I asked the young lady about our flight she didn't know anything. After a couple of calls she made an announcement. All I wanted was some info so I knew what to do next. After boarding and taxiing to the runway we were told we did not have enough fuel to make it around the approaching storm. Then the flight was canceled and re-instated in about 15 minutes. After we did land 6 hours late in Shreveport I called customer relations and they were not helpful at all. I was offered $200 toward my next travel.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-30;Only drinks were offered on flight. Not even a bag of peanuts. The man beside us tried to buy food but said they were basically out and we were only a few rows behind business class. Flying from Toronto and connecting in Miami. Lost our luggage on our connection to Costa Rica. Had to wait 2 hours in Costa Rica airport for lost luggage and said would have it later that night delivered to hotel. Wasn't there the next day and had no idea where it was. No one would pick up the phone at the airport. Finally got it the following morning when we were at another hotel 4 hours away. First and last time.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-30;Everything was fine except they did not offer any food in Economy class (you have to pay for some poor snacks). Our flight was at lunchtime. The ticket fare was $500 you'd think they would manage to fit a sandwich or slice of pizza in the budget. The Business Class passengers were served snacks hot meals and free alcoholic drinks. Outrageous.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-30;Flight from RTB to FRA via MIA. Flight departed in Roatan 1hr delayed. After the immigration we missed our connection flight. So we had to rebook for the next day. Finding the airport shuttle to the hotel was very hard without any guidance. Rebooked flight to FRA via DFW was delayed for another hour so we thought it could get close again. So we asked for the gate for our connection flight. After reaching the gate we were told that this is the wrong gate and the flight is delayed or another three hours. All ground staff were rude and not willing to get us asap to FRA. The Entertainment system is not state of the art and sometimes not working. The crew were unfriendly. Food is a joke. Never again with AA.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-30;23 March. JAX to DFW to connect with a BA flight back to LHR (comment later). Aircraft MD83. I took this flight with very low expectations following past experience and general comments. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. Check-in at JAX was swift friendly and cruised past security in no time. was offered Fast Track and then again JAX is not the busiest of airports in the US. Unfortunately there are no lounges for premium passengers unless you are flying DL or their Skyteam partners. Boarding was relatively ordered. Was greeted with a smile (first impression counts) and shown to my seat by the friendly stewardess. Unlike many European carriers on their shorthaul aircraft's the premium cabins in this case do have distinct seating in their different classes. For the type of aircraft and duration of flight I would say it was quite appropriate - no use expecting a flatbed or deluxe booth for a two hour + flight. Once boarding was complete announcements were made hot towels offered followed by a choice of bubbly juice or water. Lift off was on time and flight pretty smooth most of the time. A few bumps here and there but that's part of flying. Service was above my expectations the stewardess was extremely friendly helpful and fully justified the premium escence of the cabin. Main and only disappointment was the food. Not bad but certainly not a First Class offering. On shorter Asian and European journeys the offering is far superior in a comparable cabin. On the other hand being a nut-allergy sufferer the pre-lunch aperitif of warm nuts was a no-go for me however this charming lady went out of her way to get me an appropriate (and definitely yummier) substitute - corn chips with a houmous dip. Landing was a bit later than scheduled but beforehand I was explained the best way of getting to my connecting flight. Surprisingly and with a mere 40 minutes to spare my bag even made it to my connection. Well done American!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-29;"MIA-POS 28 March in Business Class. 757 had new seats and was 50% full so plenty of room. Departure was 1 hour late due to First Officer being 1 hour late to the flight (wasn't explained why but they kept us in the boarding area so we didn't have to sit on the hot plane). Flight attendants in Biz Class were great - super friendly and smiles. Purser came and greeted each passenger - and his partner FA was all smiles and anticipated your needs which was amazing. Food was really good - AA has changed its menu and very tasty and healthy. Flight was only 3 hours so went by quickly. Another ""Thanks for flying with AA"" from the Purser prior to landing. Keep up the good work American - really was excellent service.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-29;ORD-MIA on March 27. 737-800. Flight was packed and had Emergency Row window - my favorite seat 14F. Upon boarding F/A at door was all smiles - even joked with me while waiting for First Class passengers to get settled while I was at the door. Really fun group of FAs and all smiling. Flight was just about 3 hours and went by fast. Had cheese and crackers snack so not much but we all know the inflight catering in Economy is basically nothing so no complaints. Just bring your own food if you want something substantial. Nothing was shown on the TV's so not sure why - that's the only thing to really say was a let-down. Landed early and bag out quickly. Good job AA!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-27;My husband and I travelled from San Juan to Miami and to Seattle. Nothing was offered in the form of snacks so forget about food. Such a long ride and the seats were very uncomfortable. We had to pay $25.00 for the checked bag. I don't understand how the airlines are getting so cheap. I looked online before I left and it said there would not be any charge for the checked bag. From Seattle to Atlanta and then to San Juan I travelled on the Delta Airlines and we were given snacks.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-26;MAN to JFK on British Airways ticket but American Airlines aircraft. Very old B757 aircraft that has not been refurbished. No seat back screens. Only two choices of meal (three on virgin Atlantic). Very average quality and small portion size. Dessert consisted of a couple of biscuits. Crew were pretty good. No complaints and flight was on time. Seating was cramped. Large number of seats converted to extra legroom but for a premium price.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-26;Flight #1361 BNA-LAX on 3/14/2014. 1st class AM flight and was offered Corn Flakes or Oatmeal? Isn't this 1st class. In this day and age I cannot believe this is the offering. Where is the fruit yoghurt or hot breakfast sandwich? Coach was offered nothing. Nothing to purchase not even a miniature snack of nuts. This was a 5 hour flight. I expect that length of flight to at the very minimum offer a meal that is available to purchase.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-25;Flew on an award economy ticket RDU-LHR-RDU a very convenient route if you live in NC/SC or Southern VA. Both flights on time the food edible the service efficient if not enthusiastic the seats cramped and uncomfortable. AA deploys a 767-300 on this route a fine 20th century workhorse but woefully inadequate for the 21st century in passenger comfort and technology - only cabin ceiling monitors for in flight entertainment. The new AA/US combination will need to work hard in the future to match their partner BA and the others competing with them offering US to Europe non stops.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-24;LHR-JFK on my way to Rio and I found that the crew were very unpleasant and had a couldn't care attitude. The connecting flight to Rio was cancelled due to technical issues and a hotel was organised but we had a terrible time getting to he hotel as there was no one to guide or direct us. Very unpleasant experience both ways and the food was a joke too - serving a pizza for breakfast! It was take it or leave it as they had no other options. The crew looked so fed up to be there. I am doing the same journey again but this time definitely it will be a different airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-21;"Stewardesses were extremely rude on every flight. I had 2 connections from Jacksonville FL to Long Beach CA and then 3 connecting flights on the return home. My carry on was well within the measurement requirements and every time it fit nicely under the seat in front of me. The bag carried my pillow so it appeared to be full. Upon boarding every flight I was harshly informed that ""it will not fit and would need to be checked."" One lady even tried to take it from me. I had to unnecessarily prove on every flight that it did indeed fit under the seat in front of me. After seeing for her own eyes one stewardess rolled her eyes and walked away. The beverage service was less than mediocre. Not one staff member appeared to be happy to be there.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-19;I took AA4244 from DCA to ORD on 3/17/2014. Flight arrived on time but there was no space for the flight to park due to the only one bridge being broken. After waiting 45 mins flight finally got a free bridge. Several people missed the connection. AA could arrange the flight to wait for few mins as they already knew the flight was waiting outside for the bridge but they prefer to give us hotel and meal voucher. This has happened several times on my trip. If I could I would not take such an airline again. Very disappointed.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-19;I would just like to echo the views of A Forrest (Mar 17th). My wife and I have returned from a long weekend in the big apple so endured MAN-JFK return flights over the last few days. The most antiquated substandard long haul flight that I have taken for a long time! I'm not saying that I will never fly AA again but if there is a choice then AA will not be my first!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-17;3 flights with 3 problems in less than a month. First bad weather cancels flight which can hardly be blamed on the airline. Not being able to even reach an agent to rebook for 48 hours and being forced to use an alternate airline to make meeting. Most definitely can. Second sat on tarmac for an hour waiting quite literally for a piece of paper certifying weight and then being forced to return to gate and refuel when minimum safe fuel line is broken was not fun. Having to literally run to connecting flight is even less fun. Especially when a comfortable wait was programmed into original flight. Third went to check in for overseas flight booked by government and after standing in line (no military bypass in system for check in) was unapologetically and without assistance punted to partner airline to stand in line for another hour. Because people who ticket with AA are just supposed to know this - particularly when standard check in procedures block military travel and leaves you stranded. Do the airlines really think making people wait needlessly and unapologetically is a good thing?;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-17;"Manchester-JFK. Cannot believe there were no monitors in the back of the headrests instead monitors on the ceilings so far away you could barely see. The so called inflight entertainment (1 film for a 8.5 hour flight) broke after 10 minutes of starting and was off for an hour then anyway. When the ""food"" turned up I was given some cold pasta as there was no chicken left so it was this slop or nothing it was inedible so left it. On the way home there was a 2 hour delay and a gate change from 1 to 35. This time I got chicken but service was done in the dark and again only one film for a transatlantic flight so no distractions there or back which meant plenty of clock watching. This was my first time with American airlines and I can honestly say its the most prehistoric long haul flight I've ever had the misfortune to get on.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-14;I flew from IAH to ORD my next flight was at 9.30 but I couldn't get off the plane because we had no space for the aircraft I told the flight attendant to let them know that I was running late. She didn't care so ended up missing my flight. Poor service poor attitude poor everything!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-13;"AA51 on two occasions. 6th Jan and 9th March 2014. As a seasoned traveller countless delays and negative experiences I still go about it with a smile. The negative experiences that I have I often just take with a smile. Not so this time. American Airlines provoked me so much on my last flights with them. I travel often in both economy and business as a paying customer. This time I was in business class with ""The New"" American and their 777-300ER. The product is great so is the food and the IFE. But the crew of AA are a disgrace. From the moment I stepped on the airplane an aura of unwelcomeness was hanging in the air. The crew were stressed and did not have time for anything but to run. No smiles nothing mostly just grumpy faces. After a dinner service that took forever to get going and that was served with a slap in the face I went to their famous buffèt of snacks to have some water and some fruit. As I did that one of the two flight attendants sitting there asked me: ""Didn't you eat already?"" I stood there feeling unwelcome. I don't pay a business class ticket to be met by such an attitude. It is simply incredible how unwelcome AA crews can make you feel on their long-haul flights. I'd much rather have bad food and IFE but a smiling friendly and service minded crew.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-13;I booked travel 2 months ago for my wedding. The day of the trip American Airlines cancelled the flight and put me and my fiancee on a flight 10hrs later (in different seats) when they had other flights available that would've got us there sooner. After they flew us to our connecting flight they delayed it another hour. I normally fly with Southwest I will never make the mistake of flying American Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-12;Flew NRT-ORD in Business AA 154 on March 10. The seats and service (apart from inflight entertainment) remain not as good than the Japan Airlines flights on the same route but I saw a real effort to improve. I often find Chicago-based AA cabin attendants particularly surly for some reason but this trip I was blessed by having an outstandingly efficient and even pleasant Japanese cabin attendant who looked after the Japanese speakers as well as me very well. The connecting flight to BOS AA 2474 had at least as good cabin crew and the pilot even shook the hands with the passengers in First before the flight started.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-12;The newer American Airlines triple 7 with the 2-5-2 seating configuration is a very uncomfortable in economy class. On a recent flight from Buenos Aires to Dallas/Ft. Worth my legs were touching the seat in front of me and so were my wife's. I am about 6 feet and my wife is 5'8. The American 767 from Dallas/Ft. Worth to San Francisco had more leg room. I do not recommend long haul flights in the triple7 in the 2-5-2 configuration.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-11;I no longer fly American. I was Platinum for 12 years but I can no longer deal with their customer service their change fees and their attitudes. Flying on American is tough enough but if you have an American Eagle leg in your trip you are likely to face delays slow baggage service and attitudes that are even worse than that of other American employees. Eagle will also tend to push your price up I have chosen to speak with my wallet and to stop giving AA my money.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-10;Flew on AA1617 last night from ORD-LAX on a new 737-800 sporting AAs latest interiors all leather seats in First and Coach. The new colors seating and IFE systems are pretty outstanding. My congratulations to AA for continuing to add new aircraft and upgrade their aircraft interiors. It makes for a much more enjoyable flight experience.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-10;"This is a comment about the ""new"" American Airlines (American/USAir). My wife daughter and 15 month grandson flew USAir Express from Washington National to Louisville yesterday for a special occasion. They took off more than 2 hours late because of a broken toilet on the commuter airline (USAir Express). Today they were scheduled to fly back on American Eagle from Lousville to Washington National on a 1.25pm flight. First flight was delayed until 3.30pm and now cancelled with no alternative until tomorrow. So now they are driving back. We will do everything in our power to avoid flying the ""new"" American.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-10;Very bad flight experience. Though I was booked in Business Class the seats and taking care of food preference was horrible. My in seat entertainment system was not working. Also on top of it the control to call the attendant was not working. Even the reading light on the seat was not working for a major portion of the flight I could not read anything. I had in advance booked an Asian Vegetarian meal. I was informed that the meal had not been arranged. My seat was moving I was not sure that the seat was fully in upright position at the time of take off and landing.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-07;IAH to LGA via Chicago O'Hare on March 6th on a redemption ticket. Both flights were on-time. Easy checking and Priority AAccess helped me to get quickly through security and to board the aircraft early. Very smooth and organize boarding both flights arrived early. Great cabin crew comfortable seats and generous legroom. Definitely recommend flying AA.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-07;Can not believe they tout new planes yet can't have a consistent onboard experience. I fly 2 to 3 times a week on AA and I never know what my flight will entail. Poor options for entertainment. If you are lucky enough to have internet on a flight you may or may not have the ability to rent a movie or show which I am happy to do. Yet I get on the new airbus which honestly is just as bad as their ancient md-80's and I can either stare at the broken monitor I was given where the sound doesn't work or like the passenger next me the screen was completely broken and would not display correctly. I get on gogo and it won't allow me to rent anything yet surf on a slow and labored internet connection. How can you not bring a consistent options to those that fly you the most?;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-07;I fly about 5-12 times a year so it's not a lot but it's not a little either. I've done international and many within the USA. I have never flown with AA but I will from now on. I usually only fly us air but I'm on a flight from CLT to Dallas/Ft. Worth and it was the most comfortable short distance flight I have taken to date. Other competitors don't even come close. (I'm comparing only to those flights within the USA and mid-size) the seats were comfortable the staff nice and each seat has a TV in front of it. Well done for changing my mind!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-06;Flew on 2/27/14 from LGA to MIA on a US airways code share flight. Aircraft was newish Boeing 737 800. Seats were comfortable with adjustable headrest with plenty of space between my knees and seat in front. They were comparable to United's economy plus seats. Service was friendly and professional. The aircraft had wifi which could be purchased and the bandwidth was more than adequate for getting email and work done. All safety announcements and instructions seem to be pre recorded in a voice with a a neutral calm tone. As is the case in most US domestic they only have beverage service but they give you the whole along with glass as oppose to UA where they only fill the ice filled plastic cup. Inflight entertainment consisted of overhead monitors with requirement to purchase headphones however wifi availability made up for this.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-05;JFK-MAD return. Both flights on time and fine. 757 used which meant tired outdated and unusable IFE from drop down screens in the aisle. Be warned if in window seat you will not be able to see the entire screen. MCE seating wonderful to provide extra leg room on these long flights. Exit row seat seemed thin ended up sitting on my pillow for most of the flight! Crew on both legs were good return trip they were smiling and engaging. Something not expected often! Food acceptable but let's be honest-nothing to travel for! Multiple drink runs welcomed.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-04;AA does not care about its customers or understand why getting customers to their destinations on time matters. AA Flight number 132 was cancelled after sitting on the plane for 40 minutes due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft. The AA flight crew knowingly boarded the entire flight of passengers even though they knew the black box/communication box to the flight deck tower was broken and required repair. Many passengers had a connecting flight out of Dallas Fort Worth airport the destination for AA Flight 132. After 30 minutes of waiting with no information the flight crew informed us that the plane had a mechanical issue and the repair was being made. 10 minutes later the flight crew announced that the repair could not be made and the plane would be decommissioned. Asked to de-plane and had to wait another 10 minutes. Finally landed in Dallas. I ran through the airport and we were able to make the second flight (not our originally scheduled flight) and we made it. Flight attendants on this flight (AA Flight number 2467) were not helpful. No crew member helped us move overhead bags to get our bags up or helped communicate to another passenger to move his jacket down or a small bag that should be under such passengers seat. We finally landed in Los Angeles. We lost the chance to get to Honolulu on Saturday February 8 as planned and paid for. After waiting in line we received our voucher for one night at the airport Holiday Inn in Los Angeles and a $39.00 voucher for dinner for 3 people and an $18 voucher for breakfast on Sunday Feb. 9 also for 3 people (in LAX!).;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-03;"SNA-DFW on AA mainline in first class DFW-LFT on AA Eagle in coach. This would have been an on time departure however during a strong storm our B737-800 aircraft was struck by high winds just before push back. Maintenance was called and an inspection was made with no damage noted. The flight crew kept us fully informed and drinks were served in first class during the delay. We finally took off through very turbulent weather. The crew kept us fully informed of the weather conditions as the flight attendants had to remain seated for quite some time due to the turbulence. Once past Palm Springs the ride became very comfortable and dinner was served. The ""teriyaki beef with sugar snap beans and sticky rice"" was unremarkable although the salad and dessert (freshly baked and still warm chocolate chip cookies) were fine. The red wine from Washington state was fine as well. Cabin service was excellent. Due to strong tail winds we were only about 15 minutes late arriving in DFW and I made my connection to LFT via AA Eagle with no problems. Early arrival in LFT and my checked bag arrived on the belt quickly. All in all a terrific job by AA and AA Eagle.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-03-03;AA 1122 - horrible plane. Seats were extremely uncomfortable even though the seat next to me was not occupied. If you ever have a choice - never choose this flight from Bogota to Dallas. The in-your-face screen in my seat did not work! None of the crew cared about it.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-26;Flew from LHR to DFW to make a connection to Mexico. They use the new 777-ER on this Dallas route. It was my first time to fly this aircraft and it's really great. I think it now must be the best business class product on the transatlantic - much better than BA. The seat is really comfortable. Great if you are travelling alone and get a window seat and you have complete privacy. The FA looking after me was very friendly and attentive. The International Terminal D at DFW must be the best international transfer experience in the US better than most European airports. AA system of tagging your baggage straight through to the final destination outside the US (ITI) is excellent.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-26;This was our first and last time will be flying with AA first with the 2 hour delay that wasn't their fault but we did not get a phone call like other passengers there was no cabin crew when we boarded the plane nor did they do cabin check (both journeys). We asked about upgrading to business class we were told it was full yet there were some empty seats and 2 of the cabin crew were in them. My mother and I both paid £75 each for extra leg room yet the 2 sat next us (both journeys again) said they didn't. Boeing 757 UK to JFK several other passengers also complained about how unhelpful the cabin crew were. Will not recommend this service plus delayed 1 hour coming back.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-25;Chicago to Dubai Frequent Flyer on American via LH. Been a loyal customer since the 1980's. It's really a shame how this airline has degraded. The planes I fly are always really old virtually no entertainment system at all if it even works there's no leg room and seats are often old smelly and sometimes broken. On one flight the bathroom floor was cracked. Staff are always great but they have a really poor product to work with and their frustration shows. After all these years finally had enough will be checking out from American after next flight such a shame.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-25;DFW-SEA in new 737 which was refreshing compared to previous AA flights on old planes however the new seats are cramped and feel more uncomfortable than older aircraft. In seat VOD is a huge improvement however it appears that AA will be charging for this in future along with earphones and food. Another downside is that the screen does not adjust. Even with the seat in front not reclined the viewing angle for a person of average height is poor and soon results in a neck ache. There is the question of service or more particularly lack there-of and attitude. This flight was no exception and service was delivered abruptly and with only occasional customer respect. I asked for a cup of tea (complimentary) and was given a cup of hot water and a tea bag on the side. With AA it's a case of get on board (sometimes you're welcomed other times you're not) sit down pay for everything other than basics (and if you want water mid flight go get it but be sure to ask permission if you're not interrupting the staff talking to each other at the back) don't complain then get off (and you might get thanked for your custom from an FA who might be sat on one of the seats - although at least the Captain often thanks you). On the plus side this flight was very punctual and baggage delivered quickly but that speaks more to the efficiency of others.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-25;"Economy PAP-Ft Laud-Dallas-YVR. First leg ok - on time and crew fine. Got caught in Ft Laud customs grubby facility more than 2 hours to get to an officer (5 on duty) - but US Citizens breezed through their own line while the rest of us shuffled forward. I politely mentioned I was going to miss my connection (no sympathy) and was told ""be quiet and stay in line."" Got to baggage claim and another massive line to leave - AA agent tried to rescue me and was rudely treated by customs and I was put back in line (I said nothing). From there on a gong show with AA - later and later flights missed connections no one to help at the gates sent into a line for help and told ""we are closing - sorry"" leave security and come back in and see if an AA check-in is open. Got some polite help from one AA staff - ended up stuck overnight. Next leg to Vancouver in a brand new plane with TVs in the seat (I am used to that on Air Canada) - many passenger asked for - PA announced ""this is a new plane we don't know how to operate the TVs either - if you need help ask a young person they might know."" Cabin crew were surly and short with very polite passengers. Never ever AA again! Arrival customs in YVR in spacious and attractive area with passport scanners and pleasant officers.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-25;I am still not a big fan of AA but it looks like that they are now working harder to provide to their pax some kind of decent flight experience. Flew recently SJO-MIA-DEN/RT. On SJO-MIA still operating the old 757 but with a refurbished cabin at least. MIA-DEN newish 737-800. Nice aircraft. Ground handling efficient and friendly. They assigned me an exit row and main cabin exit seats for free without asking. All pilots talked to the pax providing a lot of flight info. The winner was the 757 Captain of the flight MIA-SJO. After appreciating his clients over the mike he also took the time to bid a farewell to every pax exiting the plane with a Thank You and a smile. Even though their inflight service still leaves a lot to wish it is a nice manner to show each passenger the value they deserve. Overall a good experience and I'll fly AA again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-24;Flight Zurich to JFK. Very old 767 plane - 21 years - showing excessive wear and tear. Dirty torn carpets and seat covers. Such an old and poorly maintained plane does not feel safe. No entertainment system other than a shaky old style TV hung from the ceiling. No magazines or newspapers provided (other than the thin airline's magazine). Food quality was average - liquor costs extra. The only commendable thing was the friendly crew and the fact that the plane was at most half full. Apparently the word about these run down planes has spread and few people choose AA on a route which also has a direct flight from Swiss. AA terminal at JFK is catastrophic. Luggage takes almost an hour to arrive and when departing the wait time at security was exceeded 90 minutes.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-24;"MAN-JFK. Used Oneworld (BA) reward miles. I had the lowest expectations having flown AA many times in the past both business and pleasure although not for some years. Check-in and security were the usual Manchester Airport slick and fast why can't Heathrow learn from them? On boarding we were met by a smiling and effusive purser who was greeting every passenger. Don't know if my BA Gold Card had anything to do with it but we were seated just behind Business in extra leg room seats. Yes the plane was an antique and had no seat back entertainment which almost beggars believe but it was clean and all seats and trays appeared to work for AA an achievement! We departed on time and arrived on time. We were served the preposterously named ""International Flagship"" lunch which was actually not bad for economy. Apart from the excellent purser the cabin crew went through the motions but were not rude or bad tempered which is a major improvement. US immigration was fast and the staff actually smiled. AA cabin crew and US immigration staff smiling what is the world coming to? Overall we were pleasantly surprised and would use again for the benefit of flying direct.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-24;"LAX-LHR return in Biz. AA put their new 777-300ER on this route and I have to say that they are nearly on the top of the market with this product. Lounge at LAX - not so great I am EP the highest but have to admit the lounge is lacking lots of food options. There were nearly none except few sandwiches. Compared to BA First class in Terminal 3 which is not their best the AA just does not stack up. The aircraft itself is great. Biz has walk-up bar which if the flight attendants are not too lazy has constant food. And this is where it becomes tricky. Flight attendants on AA are hit and miss. I flew them 5 times in the past few months. The same route. Sometimes you get great serving people who really care and would do anything for you and then you get a lady like I did who when I walked up to the bar in the middle of the flight and asked for a glass of water - since there was none anywhere had to close her game on her iPad annoyingly lifted her eyes and proceeded to look. When she found the bottle she slammed it on the bar and said "" You will be able to pour it yourself - I hope"". Seat itself is great. I recommend row 5 window - it has an extra space to store your stuff. Plenty of room to stock things up. Food - really great for biz class they elevated their game with wines as well. I can't fault them for anything in terms of hard product. The choices of movies - great. I am comparing to my recent trip on BA which had about 1/3 of movies. That really surprised me. All in all AA is trying but it has to do it faster better and more efficiently.";POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-21;From reading the list of reviews I don't understand why anyone would fly with American Airlines I however am military and am forced to fly what is given to me. Today 21 Feb14 flying on orders from San Antonio to Fort Walton Beach I was forced to pay to have my baggage checked for the first time in 8 years. I fly often and usually have 1 to 2 bags that weigh from 60 to 100lbs and have never been asked to pay. AA seems to have different requirement on baggage weights from state to state. I had no problem with baggage fees leaving Fort Walton but was charged 125 dollars on my return flight departing San Antonio.;NEGATIVE

Haven't even travelled with AA yet but already we are thoroughly disillusioned. Have travelled business class with many different airlines over the decades and never experienced such disregard. For personal reasons we need a window seat and aisle so the moment we book a flight we go online and book our seats. These are always without fail honoured. But American Airlines have already thrown us out of our pre-books seats 3 times relocating us in inappropriate seats and separated! Each time we have re-books seats but today find they have moved us again and suddenly all other seats are full! We phoned only to be told that they were not prepared to move other passengers despite them being single travellers even though they had moved us three times without reference to our wishes. We are no longer looking forward to our journey and will be avoiding AA in the future.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-18;Flight 2048 MIA to JFK Feb 15th in Coach extra. JFK was recovering from a snow-storm but that doesn't forgive the appalling service delivered by AA to passengers stuck for 8 hours on what should be a 3-hour flight. 1 hour late departure ATC orders no blame. 45 minutes holding pattern somewhere off the coast around DC a further delay. Running out of fuel so we have to land in Philadelphia. Quick refuel and push-back only to stop halfway through because the tow-bar has broken. Then return to the gate for one passenger to deplane no explanation but efficiently and quickly done. Land at JFK at 10.45 pm. No gate held on taxiway get assigned gate but access blocked by de-icing an outbound plane assigned another gate so taxi a couple of hundred yards then stop. Eventually move to gate but another 15-minute delay. Eventually get to the gate and disembark at 12.30 am. Wait for baggage is interminable and at first there is no information as to which carousel it's coming on. I get mine at about 1.50 am and that's marked Priority. In 8 hours on the plane there was one drinks service no additional refreshment except for a hand-out of an oat bar. Inadequate communication from the flight deck as to what was happening once we'd landed at JFK. Appalling behaviour and lack of customer care.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-17;Business Class from Dublin to JFK. Not a great service at all. When we got on the plane the pre-flight drinks were sitting on the table of one of the business class seats. Everything rushed. Hostesses do just the bare minimum required. Earphones faulty. Had them changed and the new ones didn't work. Turns out the socket for the earphones in my seat was broken. So no inflight entertainment for me for the whole flight unless I was prepared for visuals only. Then got a cup of coffee in a filthy cup. Admirals Lounge in JFK is a joke. Pretzels cheese carrots apples some juice and coffee. That's it. You have to pay for anything else at airport prices. Then they looked for $10.50 for a glass of wine. I thought the girl behind the bar was joking. She wasn't. She reluctantly told me that one wine was complimentary and she begrudgingly served it. How can they justify charging Business prices and provide such a sub-standard product? Will never fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-17;We traveled Jan 15 - Feb. 14. Our plane was delayed for an hour in LA and another 45 minutes in Chicago. There were only a few snacks available on our flight the TV didn't work properly and when we got home to Flint MI our luggage wasn't there and there was no reason for this because we had to wait for an hour on the tarmac before taking off.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-14;Would not recommend flying American. Yesterday morning I called their customer service/flight status line and requested the status of my flight from Cleveland to Charlotte. The automated system told me it was on time and after I selected the option even texted me a copy of the status stating the same thing. I drove to the airport paid to park went to the counter to check my bag and the counter clerk who was quite rude and non-empathetic said your flight was cancelled yesterday. Meanwhile I receive a call from my wife who says she received a call at home stating my connecting flight out of Charlotte had been delayed but the counter clerk had already told me that flight was cancelled too. No call was ever made to tell me either flight had been canceled. I am sure they would like to blame this on the merger or maybe even the severe weather and quantity of flight cancellations but that is nonsense.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-12;"Flew 2/9/2014 from St. Martin to IAH changing in Miami. We were in the first part (""extra legroom"" section) of the Main Cabin. On the first leg AA was sold out of Meals for Purchase by Row 11. (Dozens of rows behind - no food upset travelers). During the 3 hour calm flight attendants came down the row once to offer a beverage. Zero customer service. Extremely unpleasant crew. During the Miami layover had to retrieve luggage due to Customs. Plane landed at 6.42pm. Got our luggage at 8.05pm! Others still waiting after us. Baggage Claim personnel gave zero customer service. On the second leg into IAH attendants told everyone that someone forgot to put any liquor/beer on the flight. And again attendants came down the aisle once during the 2.5hr flight to offer a beverage (juice water soda only). Zero customer service. AA has a long ways to go in the Customer Service department.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-12;2/9/14 LAX to Chicago. I am extremely disappointed with American Airlines customer service. Staff were unfriendly and rude during the boarding and ticketing process. During the check-in process I received a message that I had not chosen a seat and was asked to pay an additional $68 for an upgraded seat. From the mobile phone the check-in process could not be completed until this upgrade was purchased. At the airport during the self check-in it was clear a seat had been chosen and no upgrade was needed at that time. Why are the two systems not compatible with each other? During boarding they allowed all passengers to board who did not have roller bags. This then resulted in less space for these roller bags during the boarding process. Flight attendant's allowed customers to place small bags and coats in the overhead compartments. When it came time to board the roller bags there was not enough room for these bags. This could have been avoided had the staff asked these other customers to please remove smaller items and place under the seat. Instead they were then rude to those with roller bags who did not have enough space accusing them of delaying the flight further. This seems like a rather inefficient process and one that should be reviewed to provide better customer service to those flying on American.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-11;Traveled DFW-NRT over Christmas break in 2012. Old 777-200 but the cabin was maintained pretty well and clean. Boarded last because of a late connection whisked into an almost empty first class. Food service was quick and good the steak I ordered was surprisingly good. An old flight attendant turned out to be a very funny and nice man who did everything to make the flight better and knew when to leave me alone (sleeping). Personal TV screen was not of the highest quality but personal none the less and thus enjoyable. Lay flat seat worked just fine and the ability to swivel and work on a desk was a plus. Calm flight except for circling for 30 mins before landing at Narita.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-10;"ORD to IAH. Check in was a bit of a hassle since the American Airlines staff directed us to a machine kiosk that was malfunctioning. After that hurdle was crossed a slew of others slowly came our way. Our original flight to IAH Houston was scheduled for 3.15pm at 2.55pm (local time) and arriving at 5.55pm the gate attendant told us that the flight had been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. We soon learned that the gate had been changed no announcement by telecom only by looking at the airport television screens did we figure this out. The new departure time was 3:34pm but that didn't happen either so the staff delayed the flight again to 4.04pm. As 4.15pm approached everyone was finally seated on this haggard and small CR7 jet. As we were about to leave the gate the pilot said there needed to be some maintenance and that it would take ""5 minutes"" to complete. 5 minutes passed and then 10 and then 20. By this time it was 4.25pm and we had yet to leave the gate. At 4.45pm we began taxing onto the runway when another problem arose. There apparently was an electrical failure and maintenance needed to be done once again. Back to the gate we go and by now its 5.10pm. Maintenance fixed the problem and off we go! We finally take off at 5.45pm.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-10;Booked a flight for wife stepdaughter and grandson to visit me in San Francisco from Indianapolis. (IND to SFO). The first leg to Dallas was delayed. They spent 4 hours waiting in Indy to catch a flight to Chicago. Flight from Chicago to San Francisco was delayed. What normally takes me 6 hours with Delta has now taken them 15 hours. When I had long delays with Delta they rebooked on another carrier for direct flights. AA = Anguishing Anxiety.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-10;DFW-BOG on A319: Feb 7th. This aircraft should not fly internationally. Not on a 5-hour route anyway. First class is a complete joke with only 2 rows. The bulkhead is extraordinarily uncomfortable and the last and second row simply horrible as seat cannot recline because it is placed physically against the partition between first and coach cabins. Entertainment? Lots of options If the controls work (I was in two seats and none worked properly). All these in addition to an over two-hours delay (excused by the nasty weather in the USA the last couple of weeks). What did not have an excuse at all was the extremely dirty plane (bathroom was not even flushed when first passengers boarded). AA flights to Colombia have shown substandard service and equipment for the longest. I hope all the positive changes in AA's culture that have started being evident after the merger with USAirways also benefit USA-Colombia travelers. In the meantime my personal advice to AA's Bogota-bound travelers: do not pay Business or First. AA is generally a good value in the back of the plane but not worth pay premium cabin for a substandard product and service into Bogota. I recommend AA anywhere but Colombia-bound routes.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-07;BOS-DFW-MEX and return MEX-MIA-BOS. 1/21/14 - 2/1/14. AA Platinum Desk gracefully accommodated our request for a departure a day before scheduled because of impending snow storm on 1/22. All flights on time or ahead upgraded using 500 miles awards on two of the legs. Service in first was prompt and cheerful. Food was fine-just the right menu for the time of day. Boarding well organized. Equipment well-maintained. All in all a very pleasant experience.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-05;We took our first American flight in 15 years to see if they improved and boy were we wrong. We took a 45 minute MAD-PUJ via MIA and return. All flights on time check in fast and easy. Priority boarding. On board very old planes on all sectors very nice flight crew. Their Business Class still have the inclined lay flat seats can feel a little uncomfortable for a night flight. But for other positions is OK. Food better than usual and nice selection of wines and drinks. For the first time connections at MIA went smooth and fast.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-04;We took our first American flight in 15 years to see if they improved and boy were we wrong. We took a 45 minute flight from Beaumont TX to Dallas TX. We were coming back the next morning the same time. The time for our check- in came and passed as we did not get the normal check-in email. When we checked our status they had canceled our flight. They did not even notify us to this. Then as we were waiting on the phone for Customer service we drove all the way to the airport. They sent us to Dallas fully aware that we were not going to get back home. They placed us on another flight 5 hours later than the original flight. Then I looked online to see what was going on. They weather was around 32 degrees. 281 flights had been cancelled in Dallas. At the time I looked 211 of those 281 were American Airlines.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-02-03;Flew Las Vegas - JFK 28 Jan 2014. If it wasn't for our crew the flight would've been miserable all the crew smiled from boarding to landing I was expecting the opposite the Flight attendant looking after us in the front was excellent he was always in the cabin offering drinks and so on only complaint is the seats and IFE after coming off a Virgin America first class flight they are way beyond AA's seats. The food was below par way below par that I couldn't eat it where as I could eat almost anything.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-31;LAX-NRT Economy cabin B777-200. Have to say one of my worst experiences in a very long time. Were told before boarding the IFE was broken so expect no TV for the next 12 hrs. Boarded an old plane with dirty cabins. Blanket and candy wrappers in my/ my wife's seat pockets. To my right on the other side of the aisle there was a lady with an empty seat next to her. She wanted to fold up the armrest so she could sleep across but the armrest would not stay up which was later solved by flight attendants using masking tape. My reading light was broken. American Airlines truly lived up to what US airlines are famous for - grumpy flight attendants shouting at foreign passengers who merely wanted to find out more about the food they were being served. And while on food absolutely horrible and I am sure anyone on that flight would have described it as such. Same chicken and rice dish for both meals but called different names. Same sauce same meat but one with carrots and onions. Not asking for Michelin- starred gourmet meals but this was just miles apart from coach class catering at other airlines I have flown with for example Cathay or Japan Airlines. If they can do it why can't American. Flight attendants delivering service chewing gum. Signs they were getting a tad too relaxed about their work environment. I am a frequent traveller and do not often (in fact my first time) post reviews but I really think flight deserves American's attention.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-29;LAX to LHR AA 136 27th Jan. New AA Business Class. Lounge very relaxing and bar served a variety of drinks. Nibbles were ok and more substantial food was available for a fee. Once on board this is the new lie flat AA product and feels more like a first class seat than business. Flight staff were very attentive and the service on the 9 hour overnight flight was great. Amazing food great entertainment on a large screen and the seat is great for working and sleeping too. A decent pillow and fleece blanket are provided. THe walk up bar with snacks during the flight was great as were the massive toilets in which you can change into more comfy wear for sleeping pj's are not provided. Bose headphones made for cinema sound and the amenity kit was of a good quality too. Food servings being on an American carrier are generous. All in all an excellent product and this does give Emirates and Etihad a run for their money as one of the best in the sky - well worth a try.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-29;Originally meant to flu YUL-LGA/JFK-CDG on Dec 24th 2013 and CDG-JFK-YUL on Jan 5th 2014 but a lot of changes occurred! Our JFK-CDG was cancelled due to weather in Paris. Flight from YUL-LGA was finally cancelled at the gate they rescheduled us on Air Canada to BOS (CRJ50) then British Airways to LHR. AA agents were ok and all speck fluent French. On the BOS-LHR flight (B747-400) they put us in premium economy seating was good but meal disgusting. Arrived at LHR around 4.50am we had our CDG flight scheduled at 3pm but British Airways found places for us on an earlier flight (A320). Our return wasn't cancelled as we entered the plane a B757-200 wifi- equipped we and 10 other passengers were told to go back to the gate. Given vouchers 800USD each Hyatt hotel and complimentary meals. The next morning staff helped us find the best flight. CDG-MIA-YUL. The 10 hours long CDG-MIA flight was on an outdated B767-300 but was really clean. Food was better than BA but still not as AF or Egyptair. No individual TV of course but good seat. I was able to sleep. The rest of the trip MIA-YUL was on an B737-800. Normal flight free beverages and everything else we needed to pay for. Great staff. I would fly them again.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-28;AA47 LHR-ORD in Business - maybe 70% full on Saturday lunchtime. 777-200 with 2-3-2 business class. Attentive crew a mixture of experienced and new who showed a real pride in the service they offered. Good concise communication from the flight deck. Food OK wine reasonable (although does show cost cutting vs 4 years ago when I last flew this route). Cabin showing a little wear and tear but generally OK and serviceable. IFE showing its age but again perfectly OK for an 8 hour stretch. Half the price of BA (although BA were in gouging mode because the flight was booked within 2 weeks of departure). On time departure 10 minutes early arrival. A decent product when delivered by a crew who care as was the case this time.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-28;Have flown AA F GRU-MIA-GRU several times. It is true that AA has pyjamas in First and better linen but still: cabin is always a bit dirty food is pathetic for first class with $8 wines and cheap whisky. Service has improved a bit they try but far from being a real F experience. On arrival especially at GRU priority tags are just part of your luggage decor: I have lost count of how many times I had to wait much more than coach passengers for my bags. The TAM product is far better and as they join Oneworld soon goodbye AA.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-28;"JFK to Heathrow. The flight was needlessly delayed by 3hrs at first not because of any weather or anything but just because it was not ""ready"" yet and then after we were boarded it was again delayed by 2 hrs. After we landed in Heathrow people who missed flights were not given any sort of lodging etc. This is totally unexpected from an international airline which is considered first rate. I write this comment to let people know what they can expect if they plan on a long flight with AA.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-28;LHR-ORD AA 91 14th January - a good comfortable flight and the food was reasonable. Excellent flight attendants very friendly and helpful. DFW-LHR AA78 - Business - 20th January. Although the business cabin was full the seat was very comfortable and the service impeccable. Very friendly FA's. This was my 3rd multi sector trip from London with AA and every time I have found the whole experience to far exceed my expectations.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-25;Traveled from Barcelona to NY flight # 67 and paid $89 for what we believed were extra legroom seats. Seats were cramped boarded last no space in any nearby bins for hand luggage plane was ancient didn't even have individual air controls. AA states we booked 'preferred seats' which merely allowed us to choose our seats for $89!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-25;I have flown MIA-JFK on an old B767-300. Flight was full. Seat very old but comfortable and pitch was ok. Entertainment only through overhead screens. I was shocked that this aircraft had the new hatrack design only for premium cabins Economy cabin still had the 90's hatrack design which a) looks very old and b) does not have enough room for everyone. Only non-alcoholic drink service for this 2hr flight. Staff very unprofessional. There seems to be an inconsistency in their uniform. One female flight attendant was wearing - what seemed to be her personal apron that featured dozens of US flags next to each other. After landing in JFK we had to hold at a remote stand before our gate was available. As usual passengesr were standing up and retrieving their bags from the overhead bins despite the captain making an announcement to remain seated. No flight attendant took any action only a Captain in American Airlines uniform travelling as a passenger made assertive requests for everyone to remain seated to which everyone then complied. Also saw a male flight attendant making a call on his mobile phone during taxiing to the gate. Very unprofessional!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-23;Ghastly flight in First Class on AA from PVG to LAX. The flight attendants were very nice. The seat was horrible. Uncomfortable. Had really poor leather padding a very weird need to press a latch under the arm of the seat first in order to operate seat controls. When in the bed/sleep position the seat had a bulging ridge in the middle hinge that made it impossible to lie on. There was no privacy because the seats had no enclosures or partial walls just wide open so that all the lights noise smells of the cabin were omnipresent. Bad lighting tiny hard to move video screen dirty floor cheap broken plastic laminate console patched poorly with silicon putty etc. It was like a really bad business class. Actually I've flown several times in AA's sub marginal business class and as bad as they are the seat padding is actually superior to the first class seats. Guess anyone who tolerates this service has never flown Cathay Pacific. Their biz class is outstanding. Every seat with an aisle seats constructed to provide lots of privacy good lighting headphones mirror private cabinet lots of room really comfortable lie flat seat. I used 67.5 thousand miles for my lousy AA flight.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-22;American Airlines flight 940 on January 3 2014 in Economy from Santiago Chile to Miami. No personal TV like most foreign airlines no headphones available (only for sale) wine and beer for sale only only one choice of meal flight attendants who don't look presentable no free copy of the Wall Street Journal or local business newspaper no after dinner spirits no ear plugs and eye shades and the seat pocket in front had trash from the previous passenger. The aircraft must have been one of the oldest I've flown in years. I will continue avoiding AA as much as I can.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-20;Based on a 3 day trip from BWI-DFW-SFO-ORD-BWI in first class I was pleasantly surprised and see AA as a much improved airline. Even though the first flight was cancelled due to a mechanical problem getting myself re-routed was painless though check in staff in BWI were not particularly helpful and if I did not have an app that showed me all my options I may not have had such a good experience. Two of the planes were new 737's FA's were attentive and friendly but still professional (shocking in a US airline). They tried to remember passengers' names and one gets the sense that AA is studying the premier international airlines. Food was fine but not memorable. The AA hubs I passed through all had their own personality but there was a consistency. DFW was friendly SFO professional and ORD a little gruff. The Admirals Club in each airport was good with very helpful professional staff. There is not much food or entertainment but that's not important to me in a domestic airport lounge. Reading other reviews I am reminded of my past experiences with AA and I am hopeful that my experience was a harbinger.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-20;AA79 30th Dec. AA50 8th Jan. I flew AA to PHX from LHR via DFW. Had a 772 on the way out and a 77W on the way back the internal flights were on an MD80. On all flights the service was excellent and on AA50 was quite outstanding. I was expecting very average flights but was hugely impressed with all aspects from start to finish. I would avoid row 1 on the 77W because on light invasion from the galley.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-17;ORD-LHR on 12/01/14 (QR 5288 - Qatar Airways code share). Flown AA many times overall impression has never been wonderful - usually met expectations though. This flight however was a shocker. Clapped out 767. Old CRT screens from the 90's hanging from the ceilings. Each one in the cabin had a different colour tinge. Meals were ok nothing to rave or complain about. Hostesses were surly with a bad attitude. Passenger next to my wife asked for a cup of coffee and my wife very politely asked for a cup of tea as well. Hostess snapped that she couldn't remember two things at once. Very unimpressive crew about as friendly as rattlesnakes.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-17;Currently flying from Boston to Austin (via Dallas) on AA. Flights have been on time and aircraft condition is not bad. However we are flying with our 3 year old twins who are actually very good travelers and have found that AA is not family friendly at all. They do not offer any pre boarding for families with small children. We travel with carseats for the kids because we find that this keeps them calm and contained throughout the flight a benefit for all on board but this takes a few minutes for us to put into the seats when we get on the plane and is incredibly difficult to do with many other travelers simultaneously boarding. So when they oddly did not call families for pre boarding on this flight we went up to the front during one of the many other pre boarding categories (carrying our carseats and our tired kids walking) and asked if we could pre board. We were told that we could not that others had paid for this service and we would have to wait on the side. We waited as instructed and when we got on we found that most of the plane had somehow already boarded and it was extremely difficult to get set up. We got no offers of help from any staff members. This is the least family friendly airline we have ever flown hope we won't ever have to fly it again - we fly a lot even with the kids will try to avoid AA in the future. Also in flight entertainment was broken on our of our flights.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-16;"BCN-MIA on AA 113 26 December in economy. Plane - 767 - dirty scruffy and well used. No seat back screens and on the overhead screens the first film started before the crew handed out ear phones - they were too busy preparing their sleeping quarters. Food dismal and when I went to the galley to ask for some water I was told ""Wait 10 minutes and we will be round"". But the main issue was safety. No pre take off safety check and on landing 2 emergency exit rows I could see were full of luggage on the floor the occupants on one had ear phones in and their Ipads on window blinds were shut and all this less than 2 metres away from a steward. Disgraceful. The staff were the worst I have ever had and to top it all they took 3 days to deliver our luggage. Never again will I fly with American. If I could give a zero rating I would.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-16;"MIA-JFK on 7/1/2014 on AA 1510. As with my 2 previous reports dreadful staff who did no safety checks and again blinds down and some setbacks not up. A dismal old dirty plane - 757 - which must have been 20-30 years old. No info provided prior to landing 're connections and when I asked how to get from T8 to T7 was told ""ask in the terminal"". I was so pleased that our final leg was with BA. And to cap it all American lost my Wife's luggage again. Why BA and other airlines have codeshare arrangements with this dismal appalling airline is beyond me.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-16;SKB-MIA 27/12/2013 on AS 1009. Poor service with no safety checks on take off or landing. Luggage in emergency exit rows and blinds down. We landed 25 minutes early but then had to wait over 1 hour to hook on to the terminal. On dismantling (it was at night) all the lights went out. The crew did nothing no torches at all and to cap it all they were laughing. AA never again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-16;"MAD-DFW Business: Every single aspect of the flight is mediocre and lagging well behind competition. Tatty 767-300ER with 90s interior (claustrophobic even in Business). Caution: if you assume that travelling Business means you can relax and board the last on this Madrid-Dallas route you are in for a huge shock. All overhead compartments designed last century are not capable of storing vertically standard 22"" hand carry and as a result they get filled quickly. Crew unhelpful preferring to watch the chaos instead of assisting. Entertainment is only provided by Samsung Galaxy distributed by the Crew but at least the headset is high end (BOSE). Food is the only consolation tasting above average. Did not check any luggage due to fear of losing it at DFW. And here is the final kicker: Admiral lounge at DFW gives you a coupon valid for one drink only the very first time I was treated like a homeless at a Business Lounge. Avoid at all costs.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-15;AA 57 LHR-MIA 31 Dec. Inflight service in First Class seemed friendly enough however the food and beverage suffered by comparison with British Airways. AA serves Dewar's Scotch $20/litre BA Johnnie Walker Blue Label $200/litre. But certainly AA seats while older were lie-flat and comfortable in comparable pods. Where AA fails wretchedly is on the ground in baggage claim and in passing through security in Miami where there is no 'Fast Track' access to ongoing flights. For two years in a row despite flying International First Class with baggage checked and tagged 'Priority' by the international departure airport I waited nearly an hour for the bags in Miami with no American personnel in the baggage claim area to assist and no out source baggage company access to American computers. The result is that a missed or delayed international arriving bag must be reported outside customs and security to AA's baggage service office which does not have access to bags inside customs!;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-14;EWR-MIA-SXM. On first leg late arriving aircraft meant a delayed departure and a dirty plane. Flight was saved by excellent FA. Second leg late again no pre departure beverage uninterested FA/crew and filthy bathroom. Food service is rushed and fair at best.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-14;AA27 ICN to DFW. 20/12/2013. First off Incheon Airport is a gem and it is easy access via express train from Seoul Station. On arrival at the check in we found a line that was moving along nicely. We arrived at the counter as a family of 3. I had a separate ticket as I was travelling back on a different date from my family. There was a hiccup with my ticket as they could not find the leg from DFW to AUS and we were travelling together. It took the check in lady quite a while to find it but we stood patiently as she was trying very hard. She finally had to give in and get a supervisor to help. All the while the other agents kept the line moving along and no one was stuck. The check in staff were all very apologetic and the supervisor finally found my ticket. She noticed that I am a Platinum level traveler and said that she would try to upgrade us all to Business Class. She was successful at it and we were given the upgrade. This made a huge difference as we were on our way home for Christmas and were not looking forward to that long flight in economy. The flight was 100% booked solid and not an empty seat was available. The staff were attentive and gracious. They went out of their way to ensure that our 12 year old son was comfortable and had plenty to eat and drink. Have to say that this was a very good experience from AA. Only drawback is that the entertainment system needs an upgrade. Screens are small and not a huge selection for an 11 hour flight.;POSITIVE

Without any announcement or explanation flight has been delayed until 8pm when snow storm started then airplane was de-iced after which it returned to the gate and pilots left. Passengers were given alternative flights the next day - we got 2 tickets on Delta and told there are no vouchers for the delay. We booked on our own a hotel in NYC and next day all flights were still grounded. AA kept us on the phone for hours until we called Delta who changed the ticket for us and we flew the next day home.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-13;Flew from Recife Brazil to Miami. This airline continues to live up to their reputation that they have earned for being terrible. The check-in experience was such a demonstration of incompetence and bad manners by the counter staff. Both the ground and cabin staff were not helpful and rude. They seriously need to undergo training in customer service. They were 11 passengers in Business class cabin and they'd already run out of Beef and seafood by the time they asked me for my choice of food. The food was very bad. The seat was old and the entertainment system did work for some passengers. The staff disappeared by the time they take away the food.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-13;I travel internationally very frequently on business and holiday. My recent flights with American Airlines between London and New York were the worst in years. Rude unhelpful ground staff a website that wouldn't process seat selections filthy planes and truly disgusting bathrooms. Of the seven different airlines I travelled with in the last 2 months American was the worst. The flight crew were also noisy and talked for hours during an overnight flight. I will not use them again.;NEGATIVE

Both flight were packed. The super friendly hospitality of their Cabin Crew made the journey pleasant. The breakfast prior to landing in London was made up of just one tiny croissant and a small cup of yoghurt. Their aircraft's are old and their IFE very ancient. Do not have a high expectation and you will be fine.;NEGATIVE

Cabin crew went past them on two occasions once during the beverage service and once during the meal service without stopping to ask if they wanted something to eat or drink. They were not even sleeping. Worse was when my wife called them back the flight attendants acted all surprised that my wife and children actually wanted to eat or drink anything! Yes on a 11 hour flight. Incredible.;NEGATIVE

Return was on the day the huge freeze hit the Midwest. Morning flight to ORD cancelled and put on 9.15am flight. That was delayed a few times then cancelled. Went back to the ticket counter where the agent put me on the next available flight Tuesday night (36 hours later). I asked to be routed through NYC but she said I had to deal with the ExPlt desk for that. After 2 hours on hold for the ExPlt desk (completely ridiculous but with the storm issues expected) I got a friendly agent who booked me on the 12.55pm to LGA then Tuesday flight to Chicago. YYZ-LGA flight an hour late with only 8 passengers aboard. Great flight attendants - lots of humor. Landed in LGA and went to AA desk to see if there was any flight leaving for ORD that night. Only one was scheduled (6 cancelled) and she got me a seat in coach - was very happy. At the boarding gate got my upgrade by an excellent gate agent who had a fun attitude in dealing with all the craziness at the gate. Good flight to ORD - had a nice squash gnocchi and salad. Cookies offered also. Landed 15 min ahead of schedule as there were no planes landing at ORD. It was a bad weather period but I think AA did a good job.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-09;Flew Business Class from Santiago Chile to Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777. I fly First and Business Class on airlines around the world and I don't have a problem at all with these Biz Class seats and amenities. Even though the seats are angled and not lie-flat I slept like a baby and found the different positions very comfortable. The IFE selection is minimal and not competitive with other airlines but it was decent for the 9.5 hr flight - besides meal time and sleeping took up a big chunk of the flight anyway. Dinner was good with the traditional AA sundae served at the end. This was an 11.10pm departure on an overnight flight so the meal time is odd but I was glad they offered full options. The crew were fine - your average run-of-the-mill crew who have been flying for 40+ years. They don't make any effort to make the Biz Class experience special. AA service levels are average at best and can't come close to what is offered with the international airlines. The Admirals Club in Santiago was crowded and food selection poor. Not recommended.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-09;"PAN-MIA-LHR. This flight was delayed and delayed with no information forthcoming. We were eventually informed that it was due to a late incoming flight. The delay was so long that we were eventually told that the flight had to be cancelled because the crew were out of time and they did not have a replacement crew available. We were then told that we would be taken to a hotel room for the night and rescheduled for the next day. The staff did not follow this up with any action and eventually we found out why. They had miraculously found a replacement crew so the flight was back on. Even then we were given the option of flying or staying in a hotel. By now the flight was 6 hours late. We were promised by AA staff that when we got to Miami our onward flights would be rebooked and that there would be buses to take us to a Miami hotel for the night with transfers back to the airport. The flight to Miami was appalling no hot food surly crew. I was given two bags of nuts as a ""comp."" When we finally arrived at Miami the ground staff were useless one particular individual putting on the best display of passive aggression towards customers that I have ever seen. We were left to fend for ourselves. I got a taxi to a motel and paid my own way. Luckily the hotel had a free airport shuttle the next day.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-07;"I was booked from JFK to GRU on AA 951 on Jan 3 2014. American Airlines cancelled the flight without explanation and provided no alternatives. I scrambled to find a replacement flight on my own and got a seat on AA 919 from JFK to GRU the next day Jan 4 2013. I checked in more than 3 hours prior to the flight and went to the gate where staff were simply milling about. No boarding announcements until one of the American Airlines staff said that ""The plane (which had arrived a day earlier) was at the hanger"" when it should have been at the gate. Time of departure was pushed back 30 minutes then another 30 minutes then another 30 minutes and so on until it was 3 hrs late! As a result we could not go anywhere but had to stick around in case the flight suddenly started to board. When it was time to board the famous rudeness of American Airlines staff reared its head. The gate staff started barking at passengers about boarding the aircraft efficiently. The head of the cabin crew made a similarly rude announcement that passengers should take their seats quickly. The only saving grace was I finally asked for an upgrade and got one. Still even in a higher cabin the service was poor by notoriously grumpy flight attendants. We landed several hours late in GRU and had to wait a long time for ground staff to bring the moving bridge to the plane! The only reason I stay with American Airlines is for the frequent flier miles.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-07;CDG to JFK. Flight bought at the last minute at a very reasonable price. Of course you get what you pay for. The plane (B767) looks good from the outside (new painting). Inside it's so old that I can't even remember the last time I've been in such an outdated plane. The overhead compartments were so small that even my bag pack could not fit in. No need to talk about inflight entertainment as there's barely any. It's just a few central screens with two movies played. The funniest is that business class seats apparently don't have inflight entertainment either as before we landed the crew mentioned that they would be collecting portable devices in business class. The seat was of course quite worn out and not that comfortable. At least the food was not that bad. I expected much worse after boarding the plane. Maybe it's because it was made in CDG but the pasta I ordered were tasty (even though the portion could have been bigger). What struck me was how non existent the flight attendants were during the flight. They showed up to bring the main meal and the snack before arrival in JFK and that's about it. AA had reserved the last three seats of the plane for them. Two of the FA's spent the flight on those seats while the third one remained hidden behind the curtain in the galley. You didn't feel welcome to ask for refreshments during the flight. Anyway all in all American clearly offers a substandard product. The worst product I've seen I think is that of US Airways. I can't imagine what the merger of the two will produce.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-07;DCA-LAX-DCA. 737-800. Outbound: Flight on time. Pre-ordered steak dinner was quite good. Staff efficient and reasonably friendly. Drinks service OK for flight length with a mini pre-packed snack basket (sweets chips nuts etc.) served closer to landing. Seat and entertainment system simply awful for so-called First Class with no foot rest or individual video screens. Only a video via the ceiling mounted screens and cheap earplug type headsets given free. This seat is not comfortable for a 5.5 hour flight. I hope the new seats that are advertised work better when these planes are retrofitted in the future. Inbound: Had access to the AA LAX Flagship Lounge (inside Admiral's Club) due to my OneWorld Emerald (BA Gold) status. Almost empty in the early morning with a reasonable spread of food and drinks. Flight on time. Staff more friendly than the outbound flight. Pre-ordered omelette breakfast quite good. This aircraft had the new sky interior but the same awful seats and entertainment. Looking forward to trying out new AA domestic seat and video products in the near future. Bags delivered slower than expected at DCA.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-07;LHR - DLW - Reno. Major complaint is seat allocation. Booked flight for 6 including 2 children under 7 6 months ago. Online checks appeared to show a group of 6 seats allocated together. At check in for return flight we were told that no allocation had been made and that only 3 groups of 2 seats were available. I thought that seating for family groups were a prime consideration. How naive of me. Other airlines such as Virgin can manage this simple task! DFW to Reno leg used an old Mcdonnell Douglas 80. In each direction the family were placed right at the rear where the engine noise was fearsome throughout the trip. Incidentally why not load the rear first to avoid the constant queuing to get on board and luggage stowed when loaded from the front?;NEGATIVE

american-airlines;2014-01-03;AA hits a homerun with its new business class on the 777-300. They've entirely reinvented the AA business class experience with lie-flat seats in private pods. From JFK-LHR we experienced great food good service and restful sleep. It beats the business class of many quality European and Asian airlines - and is the best among US airlines. Nice to see AA investing in its product.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-03;RDU-LHR return in Y. Outbound check-in and bag check handled smoothly no complaints. Boarding somewhat chaotic but this was mainly due to the layout of the gate area. Aircraft on this route are older 763s with no IFE but seats and toilets seemed in decent condition. Food decent enough and FAs - while not terribly friendly - were diligent about offering drinks. Entertainment was pretty miserable but what do you expect when you have no seatback system and have to rely on the overheads? Pretty laughable for an international leg. Return flight check- in at LHR was a breeze but boarding was infuriating! Pax with group 3/4 boarding passes rushing the gate during pre-boarding gate attendants barely speaking above a whisper when announcing boarding groups. Really ridiculous. FAs on return flight much friendlier. Main Cabin Extra proved worthwhile as the legroom was plentiful. All in all worth the competitive fare but not nearly at the standard of other nations' flag carriers.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-03;LHR-DFW-SJO return via JFK. I set out with middling expectations of AA in economy and was pleasantly surprised. New 777 is great seats a little narrow but what can you expect? Flights to and from SJO on old 757s but crew made both flights quite enjoyable. If only JKF immigration would work a little better. Everyone's experiences are always different but on this occasion AA looked after us nicely.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-03;Recently landed from DFW-LAX-SFO. On my initial flight from DFW to SFO most things in comparison were fine however the quality of first class compared to Virgin is excessively disappointing. There were a lot more passengers in the first class then ever the FA was running around endlessly and even forgot to give us a cookie or even a snack with our drink. On the return trip the service was much better but did not offer any pre-flight beverages. On the last leg they even failed to grab my coat and hang it up for us. Overall Virgin America still has true First Class seats the new AA first class are more like business class with amenities. The food is quote mediocre but better then before.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2014-01-02;Wanted to fly from ORD to CLE and decided to take AA for the first time after having had bad experiences with them a few years ago. Flight was canceled 1 min before departure without any information and now have been waiting for 7 hours to get my bag returned. The ground staff are rude and unhelpful if this is suppose to be the new American as they advertise it then I think they should over think their business model.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-31;I have read many negative reviews about American Airlines and was hesitant about booking my recent flight on them but due to the price of the ticket (flew first class) and the short notice of booking a flight over the holidays I chose them. Well I was very pleasantly surprised. All my flights (GNV-MIA-IAD) were on time. The flight attendants were friendly and very professional. The meals were good and the airplanes were modern and clean. I usually fly Delta but with such a pleasant experience on American I may reconsider who I book on future flights.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-30;As noted in previous posts the American Airlines of today is in the midst of a steady decline. The AA of the 70's and 80's is now just a distant memory. This week I had my 17 year old on a flight from from ORF to DFW then to SGF. Easy connection and my son knows DFW very well and can get around pretty easily. While tracking the flight it was diverted to Charlotte. Reason was weather in DFW. Delay after delay now became a mechanical issue. So arrive DFW 2 hrs late. Needless to say he missed the connection and with Christmas there are no other seats the rest of the day until 9am the following morning. If I had not acted quickly and did some pleading with AA I was able to get him to XNA 7 hours late. So all in all AA is just nothing but a band of misfits and poor maintained aircraft. My son made it to XNA where a relative picked him up and delivered to SGF 2 hours away. Picked up bag next morning in SGF.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-30;Cayman Islands to Las Vegas in December. Overall a good experience Flights on time and connection in Miami was quick. Service and food were both good. Individual entertainment at the seats will be a huge improvement over the clunky TV hanging from the cabin ceiling.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-30;AA1319 IND-LAX I'm an Executive Platinum with AA and they do treat me well. Flew out of IND on 12/26 on their fairly new non-stop to LAX in a Sky 737-800. Flight was packed. I was travelling with a small dog a Christmas gift for my in-laws. The crew was great and the FC Senior FA was especially pleasant. AA's FC seating is very comfortable for Domestic flights and the seat recline version is a favorite of mine. I had pre-selected my dinner choice on line it was provided hot and tasty. Was hoping for a sundae but freshly baked cookies were served. If they can transfer their outstanding level of customer to US Air they are going to have a mighty wonderful Domestic US carrier.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-29;ORD-LAS Return. My wife and I recently made this trip with some friends. The flight out to LAS was on an old livery S80. I was in seat 30D which meant the engines were right next to me and it was some extremely noisy 4 hours. The MD80 economy seat is not the most comfortable. ORD was under considerable snow that day and the de- icing truck broke down in front of our aircraft which delayed us going out. It was an extremely turbulent flight but the flight deck kept us in the loop the whole time. Flight back to ORD was on an old livery B738. Pushback was a few minutes ahead of schedule and overall a smooth flight until we got to ORD which was under snow again. This time we had a decent enough movie to watch and once again the flight deck was extremely interactive. Standard flight in terms of food and beverage. The FAs were smiling very welcoming warm and overall did a great job in taking care of the passengers.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-29;It is almost laughable that AA is a part of Oneworld when the service standards of AA are not even close to its alliance partners. I flew LAX-NRT yesterday - disinterested and poorly-dressed cabin crew small and uninspired meals and an entertainment system that could have been considered to be state of the art in 1990. Each time the fasten seat belt was on there were no safety announcements and passengers and crew wandering around the aircraft during turbulence. It was such a pleasure to board a Qantas aircraft for the remainder of my journey.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-23;"This airline continues to live up to their reputation that they have earned for being terrible. I arrived at my connecting flight 10 minutes early only to be greeting by the agent who says ""we gave your seat away because you were late"" then proceeds to close the door. I was 10 minutes before departure time! I am a Platinum customer! American knew I was coming. Being a customer much less one with status means nothing to American.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-23;Had reservations for San Francisco - Miami and later on Miami - New York La Guardia on my 3 weeks USA tour. The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin. Again no food onboard for a long flight. Will never consider this airline.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-21;Will never fly with this airline again just dreadful. Manchester to JFK and back just one film each way overhead TVs in the aisles not seatback. Poor food terrible tea coffee not much better staff looked worn out and as if they wished they could be anywhere apart from working on those planes. Delayed 2 hours on the way back. Two hours sitting on the plane is no fun. Obviously no contingency plan there then! Next time I'll just fly to Heathrow and fly with Virgin.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-21;I have flown SFO-MIA-Ecuador and back 6 times the past 2 years. Although the staff can seem a little long in the tooth and sometimes just mean I do appreciate the pilots. They seem to be a cut above the rest of the industry with those 757's.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-19;Having just flown American Airlines for the first time from JFK to London Heathrow I can honestly say AA are a contender for the worlds worst airline. From the state of the plane to the poor quality of the food to a laughable 1970's entertainment system all compounded by a disinterested flight crew. As a regular intercontinental traveller used to flying airlines such as Emirates Singapore Qatar etc I was truly shocked by how bad AA really are. What made it funny was reading the CEO's editorial in the inflight magazine his goal of being the worlds best carrier is a long way off.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-17;My trip from Toronto to Bogota has not happened yet as the connecting flight from Toronto to Dallas was delayed due to mechanical problems based on what we were told and they did not allow us to board the flight. The AA reps had us wait in front of different counters for more than 5 hours without resolving anything to more than 20 people. In addition they had to handle the receiving flights. The staff was rude and not friendly at all. I gave up and agreed to have my trip delayed by one day losing one entire day in my vacation plans. I hope today it will be different. I will never use this company for my business trips.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-17;LHR-LAX-LAS-LAX-OGG-LAX-LHR Nov 28 to Dec 9. I had a 2-week trip to 3 destinations in America all on American Airlines. All 6 flights were punctual and flight attendants on all flights were polite and friendly especially the last 3 flights. The new business class seat in AA's 777-300ER is the most comfortable I've had. Slept very well on both flights between LHR and LAX. I was also satisfied with the unexpected angled flat bed business class seat on LAX-OGG-LAX flights in 767-300. Overall I was very happy with their service and products. If AA ground staff can also deliver the same good services then AA will become a true premium full service airline in America.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-17;My family and I traveled on AA from CDG (767-300) DFW (MD80) Sat 14 Dec and was completely satisfied. AA excel in two areas: 1) The super friendly hospitality of their Cabin Crew and 2) They provide meals that will fill you - their pizza prior to landing is sumptuous and most memorable. Their aircrafts are old and their IFE very ancient. So if price is a factor (especially when traveling with family) they will deliver satisfaction. The game changer is when their fleet is replaced with the latest in IFE offerings!;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-16;JFK (New York) to LAX (Los Angeles). We got at the airport went straight through security which was extremely easy then sat at the gate for a while. No delays. We were in seating group 2 which was extremely convenient. We got 2 seats next to each other. They let us use all electronic devices. The only in-flight entertainment was 12 radio stations and a couple of magazines but it was a great steady flight. The food was fine. They provided a breakfast sandwich with ham and cheese on a croissant. The staff were friendly and it was one of the best flying experiences I've had.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-16;Recently flew with American to and from Key West FL. It seems overly obvious that this 'old' airline is staffed with employees who are looking forward to retiring. Late flights unusual delays on the tarmac fake smiles and just the feeling of being on a cattle car. The days of friendly flight attendants is but a fond memory.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-16;To start with my departing flight to Dallas was canceled due to bad weather. The AA rep couldn't have been less helpful. In addition when she re-routed me the new flights had no first class seats. Therefore I expected a refund to fly coach. They refused because I supposedly got a special rate which was still more than double of the coach rate and I was not eligible for a refund. On my flight home the first class section had no TV or movie and had nowhere to plug in my headphones to listen to music. My best advice is to fly United.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-14;AA 922 from La Paz (LPB) via Santa Cruz (VVI) to Miami. This flight is constantly delayed or even cancelled. Most of the time due to technical problems which means that airline politics put cost control above performance and well above customer satisfaction. Always try to find a LAN flight before travelling with AA.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-12;Thursday evening they cancelled my son's flight to DFW (due to weather) I held on the phone for 1.5 hours and even though he was flying as an unaccompanied minor and they could see I was on another flight to a foreign country at the time they wanted me to pick him up and take him back to the airport later. My friends husband came to the airport to take my son so he could then take him to his new 2pm flight. I waited in line at the airport I was flying out from for a gate agent to fill out the paperwork pay the extra fee etc. but no one was even at work at the gate. I have to fill out paperwork for my son pay and still get to my own flight and through security. My son was put on a flight for that afternoon then makes it to Dallas. Today I come back to the country and when attempting to board my flight from MIA to DFW I am told I can't take my bag on that has already been on 4 American Flights since Friday. They called final boarding. She proceeded to tell me now I wouldn't be getting on that flight. The supervisor eventually put me on a standby flight for 6.50 am since I missed the 8.35 pm flight I was supposed to be on the night before. They told me I was welcome to sleep in the terminal. At this point I don't know if I'll get on the flight in the morning since I'm standby and they wouldn't assure me a seat.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-11;Flew ORD-MIA last week onboard AA1252. First remark: I got a reward ticket using my AAdvantage points and I must say that contrary to what happens with many other carriers a free ticket with AA is really a free ticket as I paid only 2USD for taxes and that's something I really appreciate. Flying AA is a very basic experience though: plane was a B767-300 freshly re-painted but about 20 years old even if the seat comfort is okay for a 3hour flight. No entertainment just scattered small screens and no meal provided for free just drinks. Having to pay USD 25 for checking your bag is something I really do not understand but it is a general policy of US carriers. Crew professional and quite friendly and a very talkative captain. Left and arrived on time with no mechanical problems happened as in the 50% of the AA flights I had flown in the past (total-10) so no complaints at all this time and I will consider to fly with them again for domestic flights in the future.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-10;"I am appalled by AA's ticket and baggage agents! Today my 76 year old Grandmother flew on an international flight from JFK to POS through MIA and from check-in to arrival was treated extremely poorly. This is a trip we have given her every year for the past 10+ years. But from check-in at JFK - the AA agents were rude and gave the impression as if we weren't worth the time. The trip began at 3am since her flight was scheduled to depart at 5.40am - I personally booked her round trip ticket and re-confirmed the requests for wheelchair service an aisle seat and extra legroom days in advance. None of these requests were listed on her reservation and when we asked the agent if she could try to accommodate in any way we were give very abrupt and snide no's. The wheelchair took 20 minutes to come. Baggage clerks - instead of checking her bags and placing them on the conveyor we were told that she had to carry them to the gate and place them on the conveyor herself as ""they aren't paid to do so"". Her transfer in MIA was exactly the same - no wheelchair assistance listed on the system and in order to make her connecting flight my Grandma had to walk a distance - from her arrival gate to the departure gate. Never again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-09;Chicago - Toronto - Miami - Las Vegas - Chicago Every flight we took left on time. All flights were full except for the Vegas -Chicago flight which was mostly empty making for a great flight. The service was as expected and the planes were all in good condition some were in fact very new. The in flight magazine is particularly good on this airline. I was very concerned about selecting this airline as there are so many bad reviews about delays but honestly I can say we had a wonderful experience flying with them.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-09;ORD_DUS-FLR on AA/Air Berlin - 11/27 DUS-ORD on 12/8. Biz class full in both directions - I hope that continues as flying through DUS is a breeze compared to connecting at Heathrow. ORD-DUS 767-300 - the flight attendant was the only let-down: she was friendly but wasn't too attentive and talked with other passengers about how she didn't like flying long haul and was at her tolerance limit after a 7-hour flight. If you don't like long-haul then don't work it - ridiculous. Food was good - I pre-ordered it online and that worked well. Purser was very friendly. Arrived 45 min ahead of schedule and did the easy connection to Air Berlin Q-400 to Florence. Nice flight and on-time. DUS-ORD 767-300. Great flight attendant - friendly and attentive without being too in-your- face. Good food pre-ordered again online. Samsung Tablet is nice but again they don't put enough TV shows on it - you get one episode from the 1st season of a series. Overall I hope with the merger things keep getting better with FA attitudes. Good flights in general.;POSITIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-09;Flew from Seattle on December 3rd. Arriving to Chicago we have found that our flight AA4250 to Hartford has been canceled. The AA representative has claimed that it is because of weather which was impossible to believe as practically all the flights to New England had been on time. We realized lately that they canceled it due to small amount of passengers. This is how American makes its money: they lure people with low price and convenient time and then cancel the flight when there is not enough passengers shifting the cost of the night stay transportation and the rest to the customers. Shameful practice. Ultimately unreliable.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-07;Traveled one-way moving back home from Miami to Rio. They use the same ancient Boeing 767-300 that I used to fly 20 years ago on this route. There is still no individual screens in economy. Dinner was acceptable and the flight attendant even offered a repeat entree-without my asking! Breakfast before landing was a small albeit a hot croissant with coffee and orange juice. Although we departed on-time the arrival in Rio was late by almost 30 minutes-with no explanation from the crew. All in all AA is not a bad airline: I just believe it has defined itself as a mediocre carrier. If it's cheap I'd fly it again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-06;I would never have booked a flight with American Airlines had I known what a pain they are and how much they lack in customer service. I ended up taking the loss and canceling my flight to book with United Airlines. They don't have ridiculous change fees (200$ - more than my ticket cost) and they have people who actually care to help you and listen to what you say on the phone. American Airlines needs a serious makeover and judging from the hundreds of reviews previously posted saying similar things and not recommending the airline as well I am not the only one who thinks this.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-05;"Had to cancel my trip because of American's multiple delays. They called awakening me at 3am advising my flight was delayed until 12pm from its original time of 7.15 am. I arrived at the airport to self check in for my boarding pass because I couldn't print online due to the change. There was one person servicing people for ""self- check in"" in one line. So if people needed to check bags they were in the same line as those who did not need to check bags and only needed to get to the kiosk to obtain the boarding pass. An American employee should have been there to redirect people who needed only boarding passes and have separate lines. I stood in line for 30 minutes to get to the kiosk and obtain my boarding pass with no bags to check. Service attendant appeared incompetent to other customers ahead of me. The service was very slow with no pleasant smiling faces. Further I learned when I got to the gate that Flight 1202 again delayed another hour for 1 pm. Then I receive a voicemail that the flight again delayed until 5 pm and that I would arrive in Dallas 10.10 pm not to arrive in CT until Thursday at 12 noon. That was also not guaranteed. I needed to be in Hartford CT by 8 am. Hence why I scheduled the flight for early morning departure the day before. While I received a refund I didn't make my conference. They offered no alternatives to get me to CT in time on Wednesday. They only offered me an overnight stay at DFW airport red eye at 1.25 am with no sleep for arrival at my conference at 12 noon more than 4 hours late for the conference. Every time I deal with American there is always something. I will not fly American again.";NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-04;Flight that we were boarding in Denver arrived late we only had 53 minutes of layover time before our next flight in Phoenix. The flight attendants at the gates were informed we 4 along with 16 other passengers were going to miss our connecting flight due to the late arrival. 16 people. When we arrived in Phoenix to my surprise our connecting flight departed on-time we arrived 20 minutes late. 16 people late due to a late plane arrival/departure nothing any one of us passengers could have prevented. Naturally we proceeded to the customer service desk. I received a 100$ voucher for a flight costing more than 500$ no food or drink? 16 of us disgruntled passengers slept in the airport. I will never fly them again.;NEGATIVE
american-airlines;2013-12-02;I flew to New York City last Monday and I sat in the front row of coach. I got a lot of legroom and felt like I was in first class. The staff were nice on this 738. The plane was delayed 1 hour due to a winter storm. The entertainment did not work so I used my tablet. I got to have a nice breakfast with dessert and I got free baggage because of the Advantage card from AA.;POSITIVE
